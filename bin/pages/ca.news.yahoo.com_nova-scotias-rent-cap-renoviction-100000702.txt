Housing Minister Chuck Porter announced the temporary two per cent cap last Wednesday, along with a ban on eviction orders for renovations. Both of those measures are tied to the COVID-19 state of emergency order, and could be wiped away at the end of the pandemic — or sooner, depending on what happens on Feb. 6. That's the day the Nova Scotia Liberal Party chooses its next leader and the next premier of the province. "It's too hard to predict exactly what situation we're going to be in in February," said Randy Delorey. The recent health minister, now leadership contender, said he would wait to see how the pandemic progresses before deciding what to do with the new housing measures. "We need to continue to be nimble and responsive to the needs of Nova Scotians to make sure that they are kept safe in this particular time," he said in an interview. Although equivocal on the rent cap and renoviction ban, Delorey said he was in favour of the new affordable housing commission — a group of stakeholders who will advise the province on long-term solutions to the housing crunch. "I think that's the most important thing, I think the commission is a critical step," he said. Higher rent cap under Rankin, Kousoulis Porter's housing announcement came two weeks after Delorey's two competitors for the leadership pitched their own plans for addressing the province's affordable housing shortage. Some of the central tenets of Iain Rankin's proposal were similar to what's now in effect. Rankin said he would apply a rent cap and eviction ban for the duration of the pandemic. But he proposed a higher ceiling for rent increases — between four and 10 per cent, depending on the age of the building. He told CBC News this week he still thinks those are the right numbers. Story continues "What I thought was unreasonable was rent increases that were going beyond the 10 per cent," he said. Rankin also proposed striking a committee of stakeholders to advise the province on affordable housing, in the same vein as Porter's housing commission. Rankin said the new commission is missing something: people with lived experience. "But I'm not going to be critical of that," Rankin said, "because I wanted action, I've been asking for action … and I'm happy to see the government addressing [this issue]." The rent cap would likely go up to four per cent under a Labi Kousoulis government, too. He said he agrees with at least one of the concerns raised by landlords about the province's two per cent cap: it could lead to deferred maintenance on rental units. He said he's committed to the general direction of the new government policies, but if he's the next premier, they would be "overlayed" by his own housing plan. Kousoulis's plan is to keep the rent cap in place for four years, which he said is the amount of time needed to address the underlying issue. According to him, that's a lack of supply, and "red tape" barriers to new development. As for the ban on renovictions, Kousoulis said that kind of "heavy, heavy measure from government" is something that would have to be monitored closely. MORE TOP STORIES TRENDING 1.

The frequency where substance use was thought to be a contributing factor was also higher than usual.An 'unusual' development"Typically, we see someone with the first episode of psychosis in their teens or their 20s, so to see previously well people with no psychiatric history developing a first psychosis in their 30s and 40s was very unusual," said Morrison.It was that finding and the increased association with drug use — in particular cannabis and cocaine — that caused Morrison's team at the hospital to decide to take a closer look.Dr. Nadine Negati, a second-year psychiatry resident at Dalhousie University, was part of the research team. While the numbers cover all admissions in the Halifax area during the respective time periods, the sample size remains small enough that Negati said additional research and study is required.The findings could suggest people are using substances differently during the pandemic, and further research could look at whether that's a coping mechanism for stress or whether there are vulnerabilities in that demographic that have not been previously recognized, said Negati."Important next steps for us is to conduct further research to gain an understanding of what specific changes were, and also to raise public awareness that ... changing one's substance use in this time when people use that as a coping mechanism to perhaps deal with some of the various stressors, that it can have significant implications for mental illness," said Negati.Findings came as a surpriseMorrison said there is lots of research when it comes to substance-related psychosis in young people who use daily, but the surprise was the findings for patients between 35 and 44 years old."We typically say if you're going to start smoking cannabis a lot, wait until you're after 25 at least, and I think this study kind of made us pause a little bit about that," he said.If people are going to be using cannabis daily, Morrison recommends they consider products with lower THC levels.MORE TOP STORIES 22 hours ago Reuters U.S. considering blacklist for Yemen's Houthis: Oman foreign minister Oman's foreign minister said on Saturday the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East had discussed with his country the possibility of Washington designating Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement as a terrorist group.

And then we ship a lot to Alberta and just because of the distance, they have to go fairly early in November."Traffic up at U-CutBut, it's not just the markets in the U.S. and Alberta that are booming.Folkins said she's seen more visitors to the farm's U-Cut, which she attributes to the pandemic keeping people closer to home."The snowbirds aren't going south or a lot of them aren't," said Folkins. "A lot of people working from home. So they're saying, 'Well, I guess we're going to be here, we might as well fix up and put some lights on and just feel festive'."She also said more people have been abandoning artificial trees lately, getting bored with the same tree year after year."That's the wonderful thing about a real tree, is that it's never the same next year," said Folkins. "No matter how hard you try to duplicate it … there's something different in what nature provides for us."She said she used to sell a lot of trees to Ontario, but a past glut of trees dried up that market.She then discovered the Alberta market was in need of trees.Maritimes pining for firsFolkins said spruce will grow in Alberta but it's generally too dry to grow the balsam fir she produces, and that's what many people are looking for, including some New Brunswick expats."There's an awful lot of Maritimers in Alberta and spruce doesn't cut it for them," said Folkins. "They want a fir. They want something that reminds them of home."Folkins said COVID-19 protocols are in place, meaning people will have to wear masks when they visit the U-Cut and stay in their household bubble.

AdHow He Made $2.8M Trading Stocks Part-Time At Home Kyle Dennis took a leap of faith and decided to invest his savings of $15K in the stock market — $2.8M later, he owes his success to these strategies Local Journalism Initiative COVID-19 patients transferred to Vancouver Island to ease stress on northern ICUs The increasing number of people with severe COVID-19 symptoms is stressing ICU capacities in the north and patients have been transferred to other regions to ensure adequate critical care services can continue to be provided in Northern Health, said a spokesperson. “We are seeing increased need for hospitalizations and patients needing critical care,” said Eryn Collins, Northern Health media relations manager. On Dec. 4, there were 39 people with COVID-19 listed in Northern Health, with 11 of those patients in critical care. Almost 70 per cent of the total 101 hospitalizations in Northern Health have taken place in the last 34 days. “We still have capacity to provide critical care in our northern system,” said Eryn Collins. “But we’re also seeing an increase in that level of need, so we’re accessing that capacity elsewhere in the province.” Recently, two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were transferred to a Vancouver Island hospital. “It’s very important in some of our regional hospitals, such as Mills Memorial, that we ensure there is adequate ICU capacity in case of other circumstances that occur,” said Health Minister Adrian Dix on Dec. 3. “For example, the potential – especially this time of year – of a major accident on the highway.” According to the Ministry of Health, as of Nov. 30, 17 of the 41 ICU and critical care-type beds in Northern Health were vacant and an additional 23 ‘surge’ beds could be deployed, if necessary. Northern Health has the fewest beds of all the health authorities but it also has the smallest population. “The capacity and occupancy varies, not just for us, but for every health region in the province,” said Collins. The ministry’s latest count indicated two of five beds were unoccupied in Mills Memorial Hospital in Terrace; three of four ICU beds were vacant in Fort St. John; eight of 23 beds were vacant at University Hospital of Northern BC in Prince George, and four of 9 beds were open throughout the rest of the north. There were also 100 ventilators across the region, according to Northern Health. “Where appropriate, patients are moved,” Dix said. “Sometimes from the north to Vancouver Island or Metro Vancouver.” The ability to transfer patients across health authorities is an essential aspect of the government’s pandemic response plan released in March by Dix, Deputy Health Minister Stephen Brown and Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. “It was made clear at that time that this was the potential that we would be looking at if we started to see a certain trajectory of COVID activity and hospitalizations,” said Collins. “And we are, along with the rest of the province, seeing those increases.” About 56 per cent of the people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the north (and in B.C.) had done so since Oct. 31. Provincially, almost 50 per cent of all hospitalizations have taken place in the last month or so. As of Dec. 4, in Northern Health, 978 people had tested positive, while 36,132 people had been diagnosed provincially. Despite the added pressure of COVID-19 patients on the healthcare system, the province continues to have 76 per cent occupancy rate in its critical care beds. When surge beds are included in the ICU count, the occupancy rate drops to less than 65 per cent, said Dix. The province-wide pandemic strategy outlined how the healthcare system would maintain 17 COVID-19 care sites and ensure adequate capacity under a range of potential pandemic scenarios. The plan revealed the number of acute care beds, ICU-type beds, ventilators, and additional surge beds that could be deployed to meet evolving healthcare demands across B.C. during the pandemic. “We are using, as is the rest of the province, the capacity that is in the provincial healthcare system… to make sure that we can continue to care for everyone’s needs, not just COVID-related,” said Collins. Patients are commonly transported to other regions for specialized treatment, such as cardiac care in Vancouver or other reasons not to do with COVID-19, Collins said. “That’s something that happens all the time in health care,” said Dix. “What you are seeing is the public health care system working as it should in a pandemic.” Fran@thegoatnews.ca / @FranYanorFran Yanor, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, The Rocky Mountain Goat 23 hours ago CBC 'Loophole' in civic election act breeds unfairness and financial secrecy, experts say A section of Ontario's Municipal Elections Act creates an unequal playing field, undermines financial transparency and should be changed, election experts say.Concerns have been raised about a part of the legislation that allows a corporation to pay an employee while volunteering for a political campaign after a Toronto man revealed on Twitter he was paid by a lobbying firm to help campaign for candidates in the 2018 civic election.Kevin Haynes told CBC Toronto he felt like an "election hitman" when he was paid $20 per hour in cash by a major lobbying group to knock on doors for nine candidates, seven of whom won.Under the Municipal Elections Act, corporations and unions aren't allowed to donate or contribute to a candidate's campaign — no matter the amount.But a subsection of the act reads:"The value of services provided voluntarily, under the direction of the person or the individual, corporation or trade union, by an employee whose compensation from all sources for providing the services does not exceed the compensation the employee would normally receive for the period the services are provided."Simply put, an employee of a corporation or union can "volunteer" with a candidate's campaign during work hours and still get paid by their employer, as long as its not extra. That time and money is not considered a contribution, therefore, it doesn't need to be disclosed."It's an unprincipled loophole that should be closed," elections lawyer Stephen Aylward said.'Completely invisible' contributionsAylward says it's very difficult to justify the loophole on any policy grounds and notes there's no limit on the amount of time a volunteer can spend on a campaign."It seems like it's a form of contribution that is completely invisible to the accountability process that is set out under the Municipal Elections Act," he said.Dave Meslin, a municipal election expert who wrote a book on democracy, says Haynes's case is likely just the tip of the iceberg.He says the loophole allows unions and corporations to contribute an "infinite amount of resources" toward an election campaign, with no requirements for transparency or disclosure. "That loophole seems to me to undo all the other protections that we've created to make sure that campaign finance is transparent and accessible," he said. "[It] seems like it allows an endless amount of money to be spent without any recording whatsoever."Unfair election processAylward says ultimately the legislation creates an unfair playing field for candidates, which goes against the whole purpose of election finance laws."This loophole creates a serious weakness in the regulation of municipal campaign finances and to that extent risks giving a significant advantage to candidates with the best connections to large corporations or unions," he said.Meslin says that inequality can then extend to council chambers because it ultimately pits residents advocating for an issue against councillors tied to lobby groups."All those lobbyists are now owed favours," he said. He'd like to see more transparency and public financing of election campaigns so candidates don't have to look for corporate backers."Everyone's trying to influence the process for their own interests," Meslin said. "The people who get left out and unheard are the ordinary citizens." Long-time concernsToronto city council brought forward concerns about the legislation being "exploited" to the mayor's executive committee in 2009. The councillors wanted the province to amend that part of the act so compensation employees receive for volunteer work on municipal election campaigns could be defined as contributions."This is a major issue in Toronto's elections with trade unions paying employees to volunteer on various candidates' campaigns," the motion reads."In the spirit of the electoral reform package adopted by City Council, further investigation of the Municipal Election Act, 1996, has identified a loophole that is currently exploited by trade unions and corporations to influence the outcome of municipal elections." The legislation was never changed. When asked about the act and previous council concerns, the city's chief communications officer Brad Ross said the city is aware of the tweet by Haynes and is reviewing the matter.A spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing says the ministry reviews the Municipal Elections Act after each municipal election and the minister would review any feedback from local officials."Our government has not received a request from Toronto city council on this matter," spokesperson Rachel Widakdo said in a statement. 22 hours ago CBC Canada to ease immigration rules for Hong Kongers. The move couldn't come fast enough for these B.C. students Hong Kong natives Tim Chan and Maggie Tong have enjoyed the time they've spent studying and living in British Columbia — but, until recently, they had never thought of settling in Canada after graduation.Chan, now in his final year of a sociology major at the University of Victoria, had originally planned to start his career in Hong Kong, where Tong has already returned to finish a degree in social work after six months as an exchange student in B.C.But the Chinese government's ongoing crackdown on the semi-autonomous region's civil liberties since June 2019 has completely changed their plans. The pair, who have been dating for two years, now feel their home city has no future for them."It is so hard [for me] to watch Hong Kong die," said 23-year-old Chan, referring to the growing increase in suppression of dissent there."Now I'm quite sure I'll leave," said Tong, 21, speaking in Cantonese.Chan and Tong, along with other final-year students and recent graduates from Hong Kong, are hopeful they can settle permanently in Canada after Ottawa announced new immigration measures on Nov. 12 that will make it easier and quicker for them to settle here.Canada is seeing a surge in interest from potential immigrants from the region through the number of study permit applications and skilled worker applications as political unrest in Hong Kong continues. Many young residents are at odds with their government over the erosion of freedoms that were guaranteed after the region returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and a high-profile activist was this week sentenced to 13 months in prison for his role in pro-democracy protests last year.WATCH | Pro-democracy protester jailed in Hong Kong:Exact details of the new immigration pathways, which will be launched in the new year, have yet to be announced.But in an email to CBC News, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) said under its new measures, Hong Kong citizens who have graduated from a Canadian post-secondary institution will be able to apply for permanent residency without any work experience. A three-year work permit program will also be available for Hong Kong graduates of both Canadian and non-Canadian institutions over the past five years. Under existing immigration rules, Chan and Tong would have to apply for permanent residency via the federal skilled worker program or provincial nominee program — a process that could potentially take years because they do not have work experience.As well, coming to Canada as a skilled worker or investor has become increasingly competitive. Such applications more than doubled between 2015 and 2019, from 407 to 948, according to IRCC.Meanwhile, Canada has seen a surge in study permit applications from Hong Kong. IRCC figures show 1,991 such applications were received from the region as of Sept. 30 — higher than any number for a full year since at least 2015.Fears of crossing China's 'red line'Chan says he has good reason to stay in Canada. He did his internship in Hong Kong last year with a pro-democracy politician and fears this experience may stall his career should he choose to develop it at home. Since China's top legislature implemented a national security law in July, numerous pro-democracy lawmakers, activists and protesters in Hong Kong have been arrested."You never know what time that [internship experience] will be my black mark in my life," Chan said."In Canada, I don't worry about it [political censorship], because Canada is [an] open society."Canada supports the right to peaceful protest, and those people who are arrested for actions that are not considered criminal in Canada will not be denied entry to this country, IRCC says in its Nov. 12 statement on new immigration pathways for Hong Kong youth.Like Chan, Tong worries that if she becomes a registered social worker in Hong Kong, she may lose her professional qualification if she counsels youngsters who participate in civil disobedience movements.Her concern stems from an incident in October, when the Hong Kong government stripped a primary school teacher of his licence after he discussed the region's independence in classes.According to the national security law, promoting separatism is criminal."It's getting easier to cross the 'red line,'" Tong said. "I don't feel safe working in Hong Kong."Tong says she and several of her University of Hong Kong classmates are planning to emigrate to Canada via the new three-year work permit program. When the permit expires, these applicants can either extend the permit or apply for permanent residency, IRCC said.Tong has two more options toward becoming a permanent resident: She can have Chan sponsor her as a partner, or apply to study for a postgraduate degree. She's considering a master's degree in social work at the University of British Columbia, which she thinks would help her get a job.While UBC doesn't provide data on graduate program applications, the university's Vancouver and Okanagan campuses have, respectively, seen a 66 per cent and 32 per cent jump from last year in undergraduate applications from Hong Kong students who are neither Canadian citizens nor permanent residents.Michelle Suderman, UBC's director of international student development, says Hong Kong students need not worry too much about not having the minimum English proficiency or grade average to fulfil admission requirements."I certainly would encourage any student who is interested in coming to UBC or another Canadian post-secondary institution to reach out to the schools they're interested in and see what's possible in terms of alternate ways to recognize the work that they've done," she said.Chan is now planning to get a diploma in marketing or computer science to enhance his employability and hopes Tong will soon be able to rejoin him in B.C."Salaries in Canada may not be as high as in Hong Kong, but we will be able to live here with a peace of mind," Chan said. 23 hours ago Ad•Club Mahindra Why this Ad?

CBC Residents fear 'canyon of condos' on Kingston Road but planners say more density needed As the pace of development along Kingston Road in the city's east end intensifies, people who live in communities along the old Highway 2 worry it will become a "canyon of condos" and spoil existing neighbourhoods.Already, Karen Azucar says development pressures have already cost her her home in an area of southwest Scarborough called Birch Cliff."I love where I live. I'm a big part of my community. I have a salon nearby," said Azucar, who moved into Lenmore Court, a complex with three low-rise apartment blocks close to the lake on Kingston Road just west of Birchmount Road, five years ago.The owner of Salon O found out a few weeks ago that the buildings would be torn down and replaced by a nine-storey condominium tower. She's upset news of the"demoviction" came in the middle of a pandemic."I had just re-opened my salon and I was trying to get back into business after not working for three months and I just can't deal with this right now."The developer and local councillor say the project is in its early stages and open to community input. A meeting is planned for next week.It's just the latest example of redevelopment moving outward from the core as neighbourhoods along Kingston Road become desirable places to live. The city's official plan encourages intensification — building denser, more heavily populated neighbourhoods with more condo complexes and apartment buildings — along such major arterial roads.As a result, there are dozens of projects along the road in various stages of planning, approval and construction as the city has designated "urban growth centres" along such intensification corridors.John Hartley has lived in The Beach area for four decades, but five years ago, he bought a home on picturesque Lakeside Drive. which begins at Kingston Road and ends at Lake Ontario. He plans to fight the plan to build a nine-storey condo complex steps from his front door."It's an attack on my home, plain and simple," said Hartley, who believes the COVID-19 pandemic has put arguments for intensification to the test as people are moving out from the downtown core."Putting in another 265 units on top of the 6,000 already proposed for Kingston Road, it's just a failure of planning."Frank Clayton, a senior research fellow at Ryerson University's Centre for Urban Policy and Land Development, recently reviewed how pre-zoning areas for intensification can help speed up the supply of needed housing.And he also used to have an office not far from Lenmore Court."Cities have to grow. And they have to grow up or out," said Clayton.He said Kingston Road is ripe for redevelopment. It had been the major eastern route in and out of Toronto to Kingston and Montreal before Highway 401 was built in the 1960's It's still a way tens of thousands of commuters get to and from downtown."Even with a pandemic there's a huge demand for housing, but with development there's a huge lag," he said. "If supply doesn't respond to demand, prices go through the roof."Urban planners like Clayton prefer what they call "densification" to sprawl. They say it encourages walking and cycling to work, public transit, safety, and energy efficiency, whereas building more suburban subdivisions leads to more car use, consumption of fossil fuels, pollution and the paving over of valuable farmland and green space.The push for more density is the reason more condos are getting built outside the downtown core, and why the mid-rise boom in Leslieville and The Beach is rippling outward along Kingston Road and Queen Street East.Clayton says height and density are dictated by the costs of the project, not community demands. He says heights of eight and 10 storeys are not unreasonable along Kingston Road."It can't be just what the local community wants.It's got to be a combination of what works from a development perspective, the developer can make money on, because they always want to make money, and they provide housing."But those in the community worry about what it will look like if developers have free rein."It's absolutely going to be a canyon of condos. They are too dense, too wide and too high," said Anna Dewar Gully of the Birch Cliff Village Community Association.She points to the Kingston Road Revitalization Plan, unveiled in 2010 in which the city agreed to limit building heights for much of the area from Birchmount Road to Warden Avenue to between four and six storeys, "There just seems to be a foregone conclusion that if developers want more density then what's in the plan that was carefully consulted on in this community ... we are going to defer to that need to make tons of money." 21 hours ago euronews Videos Sputnik V: Russia rolls out its COVID-19 vaccination programme Russia has started its COVID-19 vaccination programme, with the first jabs going to workers at high risk of becoming infected with coronavirus.View on euronews 22 hours ago CBC Confused by the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic? Don't worry, so are the economists The numbers can be so big, they're hard to get your head around. The swings are so volatile, you can lose your footing.And yet, with millions of Canadians struggling through the COVID-19 crisis, many of us want to understand what is going on with the economy."My head is spinning, too," said Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at CIBC. "So I don't blame people, because we've never seen anything like this."Every week, a flood of new data comes out. This week, we were inundated with the federal government's fiscal update, GDP figures and job numbers. All trying to shape the story of the economy. Sometimes the numbers contradict each other. Sometimes they give a sort of head-fake and contradict themselves.The fiscal update that came out on Monday had built all its projections on an average of the forecasts from the big banks. The next morning, Statistics Canada released quarterly GDP numbers that missed the forecast by a staggering seven points. By the end of the week, jobs data came out showing Canadian employers added three times as many jobs as expected.Every economist is trying to figure out what those numbers are telling us. And they're not always getting it right."Economists have never been more wrong about where the data would come through," said Frances Donald, chief economist and head of macro strategy at Manulife Investment Management in Toronto.New methodsMost of the time, she said, economists rely on data such as job growth and retail sales numbers to make sense of the situation. The problem is those statistics tell us what was happening months ago."This is a daily crisis that requires daily data points," she said.To combat that, economists have turned to higher frequency data such as google mobility trends, restaurant reservation tallies and public transit numbers.But Donald said the bigger issue is the unique, unprecedented nature of this crisis. "We don't have a functional precedent for what is happening," she said.There may be other moments in the past that share some similarities, but nothing experts can use to model probable outcomes.Change of perspectiveTal said he understands why more Canadians than usual seem to be following economic updates with bated breath. But he said the best option is to focus less on the details and think of the broader economic themes.So, while the short term is bad, he said, the medium term looks better."We are buying time at this point," he said, until the virus comes under control. Yes, the world is headed into a long and dark winter, he said. Yes, COVID-19 cases are rising and government-imposed restrictions could spread. And, yes, households and businesses will need government support and record-low interest rates to provide them a bridge to the second half of next year, he said.But if you zoom out and look at the longer-term forecasts, the second half of next year shows a lot of promise. Tal said the economic crisis is largely due to the fact that people aren't spending as much as they normally would.Some of that is because of government-mandated closures.But some of it is also a question of confidence.Even if the movie theatres were open, how many people would pay to sit in close contact with strangers for a two-hour film?Looking aheadThat spending issue is a large source of the hope for 2021. Tal calculates that Canadian households and businesses are sitting on $170 billion in savings. And once the virus comes under control, he predicts that money will spill back into the economy."I see this unleashing of potential demand in the economy," he said. "Most of it will be in the services sector. And that will benefit employment for people that are struggling. It's just a question of time."So, in the interim, he recommends not getting too caught up in the minutiae of the daily economic data.That's advice financial markets seem to be following. As COVID-19 case counts soar and government-imposed restrictions spread, the major stock market indexes are all climbing. Donald said markets seem to be looking past the short- and medium-term unknowns and banking on a solid return next year.WATCH | The National's report on the fall economic update: She said the markets don't seem to be too caught up in the daily barrage of economic information."The markets are thinking ahead to where we are going to be in 6, 12, 48 months," she said. "Not where we are at this very moment."Besides, she said, one of the best indicators available is to just look around and see how people around you are acting. Are people nervous and scared?

CBC The high mental toll of the pandemic, and what to do about it There is sadness, but most of all boredom.Linda Foy, an octogenarian grandmother of three who lives in Montreal West, recently decided to knit a hat for her daughter because, well, she couldn't think of anything better to do.Behind the ennui lurks frustration."I'm angry. I'm angry, and I don't know who I'm angry at," she said. "I'm not angry at [Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau or [Premier François] Legault, or the Chinese. I'm not angry at anybody. I'm just angry that all of us are in this situation."Like everyone else who lives in a so-called "red zone," Foy's family has had to scrub its Christmas tradition, which usually involves a lavish breakfast and plenty of conversation.She saw it coming and understands why — one of her sons is a physician at the Montreal General Hospital — but it's still hard psychologically."It was so contradictory and the conditions were so ridiculous: 10 people here and 10 people there. I was really expecting there to be no Christmas and so I wasn't surprised. But the announcement made me face the reality, which I've been avoiding for many months of COVID," Foy said.The worst part? No hugs."I hate it," she said."We're very affectionate, very tactile, and I miss it terribly."Foy says she is coping as best she can, like most Quebecers.Her story is mirrored across the province: forced isolation, hopes of a normal-ish Christmas dashed, the stress and frustration of not knowing when it will all end.The psychic toll is mounting as the pandemic drags on. Here's a look at exactly how it's affecting our collective mental health, and what can be done about it.Growing problemA pair of recent surveys hint at mounting distress in the province.The Early Childhood Observatory recently published the results of a poll of parents with children under the age of six. It found 44 per cent of respondents said the pandemic is affecting their ability to stay calm around their kids, and 79 per cent said they had not sought out an external support service."This is very preoccupying, we know these parents are stressed and they can't count on their loved ones to help with their kids," said the observatory's Fannie Dagenais.This week, a Université de Sherbrooke team, led by public health specialist Dr. Mélissa Généreux, released the second instalment in a longitudinal polling study it launched in the late summer.The survey reached 8,500 adults in all regions of Quebec and was conducted from Nov. 6-18.Nearly half the respondents aged 18 to 24 presented "significant symptoms of anxiety or major depression." About one-third of the health care workers surveyed demonstrated a high prevalence of the same, as did an increasing proportion of people who work at home.Among the other findings: * One in four adults (one in two young adults) report symptoms consistent with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression. Men and young people are especially affected. * Suicidal ideation is twice as common, jumping from three to six per cent of responses since the summer. * Psychological disorders are much more present in Montreal. * Heavy drinking is on the rise among those 35 and over. * More than one-quarter of respondents perceive public health regulations as exaggerated and unclear.What can be doneMarie-Claude Geoffroy, an assistant professor in youth psychology at McGill University who holds the Canada Research Chair in Youth Suicide Prevention, said staying connected is key — whether through a phone call, a text message, an email or a video chat."Let your friends know that you are there for them," she said.Geoffroy is leading a team of researchers at McGill tracking a group of young adults. She found that young people who felt they have higher levels of social support reported fewer mental health problems.She is planning to follow up with the same cohort this winter, to see how the pandemic has affected her findings.Généreux, for her, part suggested raising an army of peer counselors."One thing I would suggest to people who are feeling not so bad is to get trained with the psychological first-aid training," she told CBC Quebec's Breakaway, citing the online offering from the Canadian Red Cross."This way, if you get the training you're going to feel much more comfortable to bring some support to people you may encounter. Your neighbours, family, friends, colleagues, that may display some signs of distress."Shirlette Wint, a psychotherapist and social worker based in Montreal, said moments of quiet, away from others, can be seen as "bittersweet," providing us with an opportunity for introspection."It's allowed a lot of people to really make some life-changing decisions," she said.For some of her longtime patients, who struggled with anxiety before the pandemic, the upheaval of 2020 has created "a kind of comfort.""They are not just being anxious for nothing," she said."It allows them also to feel supported because now it's the entire society that has the same concern."While challenging and often upsetting, Wint said the commitment to following public guidelines should be seen as a chance to contribute to something larger than one's self."I see this really as: yes, it's sad, but it's an opportunity to express gratitude in so many different ways," she said.Beyond that, one of the main ways to remain mentally healthy is to stay physically active.The province has set up an online guide with ideas for how to stay mentally healthy.Among the suggestions: * Do physical activities that enable you to relieve stress and eliminate tension. * Enjoy the little pleasures of life, like listening to music, reading or taking a warm bath. * If you live close to nature, take walks and breathe deeply and peacefully.Where to get helpQuebec has expanded its 811 hotline to offer more assistance for anyone in need.Other resources include: 23 hours ago The Canadian Press Romania: Election expected to usher in 'European' generation BUCHAREST, Romania — Romanians will vote Sunday in a legislative election expected to restore some measure of stability in a country with one of the European Union's highest emigration rates, and bring to power a generation that came of age in a time of national turmoil and strongly identifies as European.Cabinet shakeups and no-confidence votes have given Romania five prime ministers in as many years. According to most pre-election polls, the weekend vote is likely to favour reform-oriented politicians united in their resolve to keep Romania in step with the EU mainstream and away from the camp of other post-communist nations, such as Hungary and Poland, with their populist, euroskeptic leaders.The centre-right National Liberal Party, known by its Romanian acronym PNL, appears set to become the top vote-getter. But the mainstay party of Romania's EU-aligned, austerity-prone social conservatives is expected to fall far short of a parliamentary majority.Its main rival, the left-leaning, populist Social Democratic Party, or PSD in Romanian, won the last election in 2016 and ran through three prime ministers before PNL first took the reins of a minority government a year ago. The PSD-led government had drawn heavy criticism from the EU for its interference with the judiciary and a cascade of corruption scandals involving some of its most prominent members.The Social Democrats' chaotic tenure triggered two years of massive street protests that gave voice to a new generation of relatively young, foreign-educated and proudly European politicians who point to widespread graft and fraud in Romanian government ministries and state institutions. Some of them now are running for seats in parliament.“There are many state institutions under political control which function really badly, and the problems there need to be exposed,” said Valeriu Nicolae, a human rights activist who is running as an independent candidate. “MPs never tackled these issues because everyone has an interest in these state institutions. They either have relatives working there, friends or party members, and it’s not nice to expose your friends.”Nicolae is an initiator of the RESPECT anti-racism campaign in football, launched at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, one of the most visible campaigns of this sort in the world, and says that in the past he was “treated horribly (for) being Roma” in Romania.He said he decided to run after witnessing what he considered to be a weak effort to prevent “a man accused of horrible things and a very dubious person” winning a district mayor's election in the capital, Bucharest. In one week, Nicolae collected 13,000 qualifying signatures, 3,500 more than he needed to get on Sunday's ballot.“I am convinced that (change) is possible,” he said. “I am not bound by an interest to protect my political career. My life quality will suffer if I get into parliament.”A more organized new force is USR-PLUS, a mix of pro-EU technocrats and social-justice and anti-corruption activists that coalesced last year into a progressive political alliance. Polls predict the alliance, whose members hold divergent views on many cultural issues, will get around 20% of Sunday’s vote for both chambers of parliament.That's the same share forecast for the PSD, which has dominated Romanian politics since the fall of communism in 1989.The alliance has targeted young and disillusioned voters, including with pledges to depoliticize and fully reform Romania's civil service and eradicate corruption. It has also promised to eliminate income tax for minimum-wage workers and create well-paying jobs to lure back young, highly educated Romanians who have been leaving in droves since the country joined the EU in 2007.“It’s good to see a new generation of leaders who understand the needs of our society and are professionally and personally fit to meet them,” said Dacian Ciolos, who represents Romania in the European Parliament and is one of the progressive alliance’s top leaders. “It puts pressure on us, as a new political entity, because we have to meet higher expectations.”The alliance has pledged not to be part of a parliamentary majority that would include the PSD, which has accused prominent USR-PLUS members of being part of a dark anti-Romanian conspiracy linked to Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, a favourite bogeyman of Central European populists. At the same time, USR-PLUS has indicated it has no intention of playing second fiddle to the PNL in a future coalition government.Some analysts predict the USR-PLUS alliance will try to assert itself in a future governing coalition by demanding a reconfiguration of the government and the prime minister's job for Ciolos, 51. He served a stint at the helm of Romania’s first, short-lived technocratic government several years ago.It would be a bitter pill for the PNL, but one it might be forced to swallow if it wants to preserve its image as a party driven by a genuine desire to rid Romania of a corruptive welfare state model, which it blames on PSD's decades-long dominance. Most analysts think the conservative PNL and the progressive alliance will find a compromise.“It’s in their best interest to govern together despite their (ideological and economic) differences which are incomprehensible to most of their supporters,” political analyst Andrei Taranu said.Romania was plagued by widespread poverty before the coronavirus pandemic, with over 25% of the population of 19 million living on less than $5.50 a day. The pandemic has exacerbated structural problems, including the near collapse of the public health care system.To date, the EU's seventh-most populous country has confirmed over a half-million virus cases and more than 12,000 deaths. As a result of the pandemic and virus containment measures, Romania’s fiscal deficit is expected to widen this year to around 9% of gross domestic product, compared with 4.3% in 2019.Nicolae, who himself grew up in poverty, has dedicated his life to helping vulnerable children escape a life of misery and drug-abuse, and giving them access to education.“Although I say all the time ‘I’m a gypsy I’m a gypsy,’ people no longer register me like that” he said. ”That I, a Romanian Roma, ran as an independent and I managed to gather the necessary signatures, is a very good signal. And if I win, it would be a great signal."Some 18 million people are registered to vote on Sunday at 18,000 polling stations across the country. In a reflection of the importance of the Romanian diaspora living and working abroad, there are also 748 polling stations in other countries, almost twice as many as there were four years ago. Voters will be filling 136 seats in the Senate and 329 in the Chamber of Deputies.No special virus precautions have been put in place beyond the general requirements to wear masks, sanitize hands and maintain social distancing.___Andreea Alexandru in Bucharest contributed.By Vadim Ghirda And Sabina Niksic, The Associated Press 21 hours ago CBC How this cat became TikTok famous and has his own merch line Erin Gallant of Charlottetown was living a fairly quiet, low-key life of a stay-at-home mom in her mid-30s — but that changed this summer, when her 13-year-old orange tabby cat went viral.Reznor the cat has 87,000 followers on TikTok and is gaining thousands daily, and his posts have more than four million likes. "Obviously I'm very excited, who wouldn't want to have a famous animal?" said Gallant. "I think he deserves all the hype."Gallant got Reznor when he was less than six weeks old. He's always been unusual in that he is polydactyl — he has extra toes that resemble thumbs. He's also part munchkin, a feline breed with shorter legs.Personality-wise, he is "very dramatic," she said, and loves attention. The two are inseparable. He'd always been popular with her friends and family, and Gallant had made some Instagram posts featuring Reznor, but he didn't even crack 1,000 followers on the platform. Then the pandemic hit and many people downloaded the TikTok app, which features mostly lighthearted short dance and lipsync videos. It's even launched some stars — like Reznor. 'Perfect cat storm' "A lot of people had more free time, I guess you could say, during quarantine," Gallant said. "I always told myself I would never go on TikTok, I thought it was for the younger generation, but my friends kind of got into it then so did I, and I started noticing there was a big area there for cats." Gallant began posting videos of herself and her three cats, but it was the videos of Reznor that took off. "I guess I must have hooked on to that cat community, or cat TikTok as they call it," she said. It was a "perfect cat storm, he must just have what everybody likes. Friends start tagging each other and then people start making requests and I start fulfilling those requests, so it's more of an interactive thing and I think his fans and followers really like that."Requests come from all over the world to give Reznor a "boop" or tap on the nose. People in Italy, France, Australia, Lebanon, Armenia, Ethiopia, Russia and dozens of other countries ask Gallant to boop or pat Reznor for them if they are having a bad day, taking exams, recovering from surgery or just because he is "so cute!" They also want to see closeups of his extra toes, or watch Gallant dressing him in a variety of clothes such as sweaters and a Santa outfit. He has an Amazon wish listThat her cat suddenly has followers all around the globe is a bit surreal, Gallant said, when she steps back and thinks about it."It feels extremely weird. And I don't even like calling them followers, because even that sounds weird to me — I like to call them his friends, really, because they're very sweet people. They give me advice, they're just kind in general for the most part, and they love sending him gifts."Oh yes, the gifts. Sweaters and beds and treats and toys and outfits and dishes, all sent by complete strangers. > Sometimes it does get to be a bit much. — Erin Gallant"He has an Amazon wish list," Gallant said. "His friends were asking ... can we send him things?" She set up an online wish list, because she didn't feel comfortable making her address public, she said."It's a pretty genius idea really," she said. When Reznor gets packages, Gallant said her three-year-old daughter can get a little jealous, so she involves the toddler by getting her to open the gifts and give them to Reznor. The family has two other cats that enjoy sharing his wealth — Reznor's "wife" Stevie Nicks who is another ginger tabby, and Tucker, the black-and-white tuxedo cat. Tucker is also becoming popular on TikTok, Gallant said, and people are asking for more videos of him. He is handsome but more reserved than Reznor. Gallant said she'll consider it in the future, but right now keeping up with Reznor's account keeps her quite busy."It has become a part-time job," she said. She posts 10 to 15 short videos some days, with usually two or three of those videos going viral. "I'm considering making Sunday a no-post day. Sometimes it does get to be a bit much."She has told her neighbours what she's doing, she said, "so I don't feel as ridiculous when I'm out in my yard, sometimes in my pyjamas, filming my cat!" What's a star without merch?Besides buying Reznor gifts, Gallant said as soon as he started to become famous, his fans began asking daily for Reznor-branded merchandise. So Gallant obliged."I don't know anything about that, so I asked for help," Gallant said. She found a website where she said creating merchandise with Reznor's image on it was easier than she thought. > A lot of people want the Reznor plushy, and I don't blame them, he's a pretty squishy guy. — Erin GallantShe said people have been enjoying purchasing T-shirts, hoodies, mugs, stickers, face masks and more."We're doing pretty good, not going to retire on it but it's really interesting, we're having a lot of fun doing it," she said. They have had many requests for Reznor calendars and Reznor plush toys, which are next on her list to research and design. "A lot of people want the Reznor plushy, and I don't blame them, he's a pretty squishy guy," she said. "People have been saying forever, 'Reznor needs to earn his keep.' I think he's doing a great job!" Although he is almost 14 now, Gallant said Reznor's health is very good. She takes him out in her yard for supervised walks and he has regular vet visits. "He's not slowing down any — he is a little bit chonkier, we are watching his weight," she said. More from CBC P.E.I. 21 hours ago Ad•Morningstar Why this Ad? Ad Feedback Why don't you like this ad?

More from CBC P.E.I. 22 hours ago CBC Sask. teen reclaiming disability symbol through clothing brand A 19-year-old from Saskatoon is using a new clothing brand to reclaim a symbol that often hangs over people with disabilities.Bryson Bolianatz has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. After growing up seeing a lack of representation of persons with disabilities in the world of fashion, he decided to do something himself with his free time during the COVID-19 pandemic."I was like 'You know what? If nobody else has done this before me, I'm just going to be the guy to do it,'" Bolianatz said. In Oct. 2020, Bolianatz launched the Best Legs Supply Company. Every piece of clothing features the handicapped symbol shown on parking stalls or bathroom doors. "The whole thing is centred around using disabilities as a pride thing rather than like something to look down on," he said. "Let's take that. Let's put it on my shirt. Let's get people excited about it."John Loeppky is a disabled artist and freelance writer who often speaks about issues affecting people with disabilities. He said it's Boliantz's idea is great. "What Bryson is talking about in terms of reclaiming that symbol that has, sort of hangs over the community in some ways, and reclaiming it through a Saskatchewan clothing brand, I think that's a great millennial way of doing things," Loeppky said. Bolianatz designs each piece of clothing himself as things he would like to wear out, he said. They often have bright colours. He likes to make sure 'Best Legs' is on each as well."A lot of people like when they hear the name 'Best Legs,' they kind of like laugh … no doubt, there is like an element of comedy to it," Bolianatz said. "The way I look at it is 'Best Legs' doesn't necessarily mean like our legs are the best. It just means that we as a community and as a group of people do the best we can with what we've been given."The response has been more than expected, Bolianatz said. "Actually a lot of my sales, and this is something that I'm actually really proud of, have come from able-bodied people, which I think is super important," he said. He wanted to reach other people with disabilities and was glad to see able-bodied people get on board, he said. There was even an exciting collaboration with the music group Portugal. The Man."Their guitarist, Eric Howk is his name, he is a wheelchair user. When I was starting the company and trying to get stuff off the ground, I reached out to him on Instagram and I was like, 'Hey, man, I know this is kind of a shot in the dark, but this is what I'm doing.'"Harlock responded and said he was absolutely on board. Boliantz said he couldn't believe the famous musician was interested in a collaboration. In the future, Bolianatz said he hopes to get Best Legs to be a mainstream company that people can recognize simply on the street. "I wanted to get to a point where everybody is like, 'Oh yeah, I'll wear this," he said. "'This is cool clothing and a cool message.'" 21 hours ago CBC Long-term care home outbreaks growing again in the province Outbreaks in long-care homes in the province are growing in number and scope, with two more homes in Montreal high on the government list of outbreaks. The number of cases at the Manoir West Island in Pierrefonds has nearly doubled since Sunday and family members say they are in the dark about how their loved ones are doing. As of Thursday, 56 residents, or 64 per cent of the home's capacity, had tested positive for COVID-19 and six had died. Just four days earlier, that number was 33 infected residents and zero deaths. "That's six deaths in one week," said Gladys Chan, whose 88-year-old father has lived at the home since October 2019. "It's just very alarming." Chan says staff have been hard to reach and when someone did get in touch they weren't able to tell her if her father had had another test since he tested negative over the weekend. "They're doing it just to say they've done it, they've contacted the families. But we don't know what's going on in there. We don't know what's happening to my father," Chan said. "It's almost the same as having dead silence."Betty Wilson, a 94-year-old resident at the Manoir who tested positive for COVID-19 Monday, said earlier this week the home was so short-staffed she had to ask several staff members and wait a significant amount of time before getting help to go to the bathroom because she is in a wheelchair. Crisis unit set up at ManoirA spokesperson for the local health board, the CIUSSS de l'Ouest-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, says all employees and residents underwent testing for the virus as soon as some began showing symptoms. The spokesperson, Hélène Bergeron-Gamache, said a crisis unit has been set up at the Manoir and that the health board sent extra teams of staff to help out. "The CIUSSS outbreak management team is also present to strengthen the implementation of good practices in infection prevention and control," Bergeron-Gamache wrote in an email. "Our priority is to ensure the health and safety of residents and staff, and all of our efforts are directed to that end."Another long-term care home on the island has seen a steady rise in positive cases since early November.Many asymptomatic cases at Château WestmountAt the Château Westmount, 46 residents — or 43 per cent of the home's capacity — had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Thursday, putting it right below the Manoir on the government list. Yves Vincelette, the nurse in charge of infection prevention and control at Château Westmount, says the home is hoping to have its outbreak under control within the next couple weeks.Vincelette says many of the infected residents are asymptomatic and 16 have recovered from the disease. The home had been grouping infected residents in red zones, but Vincelette says, after consulting with the local health board, he and his team decided to isolate residents in their rooms instead. "It didn't work out well, we still had some spread outside those zones," he said. "It's also easier this way, so the residents don't have to move around, they stay in their own environment."There are staff dedicated to rooms with infected residents and others to rooms where residents have tested negative. He says the home has been in touch with families every day, prioritizing those who have relatives who are sick, and has also been posting a daily blog on its website with updates. Vincelette says the outbreak was likely caused by staff members who came into work without symptoms but may have already been contagious. "It's a very contagious virus so, as of now, what we've seen is asymptomatic employees who came in, who unfortunately contaminated one of more residents and it spread from there," he said. Friday, the independent committee charged with deciding who should be the first Canadians to be vaccinated against COVID-19 released its final directive recommending that long-term care home residents and seniors over the age of 80 get priority access to the vaccine. 22 hours ago Ad•Cars24 Why this Ad?

When a TCDSB student is suspended or expelled, he or she is invited to attend the Transitional Intervention Program for Suspended Students (TIPSS), while waiting for an expulsion hearing.Where a student attends TIPSS is based on where they live. Cuff had been traveling by bus from his home near Jane Street and Finch Avenue West to classes at the Toronto Public Library branch in The Junction near Jane Street and Dundas Street West. Cuff's mother, Kisher Thomas, says she feels the TCDSB is forcing her to choose between her son's health and his education."With COVID going around I'm concerned about his safety. Imagine going out, something happens, and God forbid, you get infected. What are you going to tell me? 'Oh, we're sorry?'"Family wants same choice other students were givenThe Ministry of Education requires all school boards to provide the option of full-time online classes this school year."School boards must work collaboratively with parents to ensure that all students have access to remote learning," the ministry said in a statement.Cuff's relatives say that option wasn't immediately available to him.The TCDSB says although it is committed to ensuring all expelled students have the opportunity to continue their education, some classes may be in person."Under the Education Act PPM 142 - School Board Programs for Expelled Students, the program includes an assessment of the attitudes and behaviour of the student as well as observing and assessing their interaction with other students and staff, all of which requires in-person attendance," the TCDSB told CBC News in a written statement.The TCDSB has since confirmed it will accommodate families who request a fully remote option during the pandemic, including those of students in suspension or expulsion programs, to "ensure the safety and well-being of a child." Thomas says she requested full online learning for Cuff in November, ahead of his expulsion hearing.Paul Raso, executive director of the non-profit organization Education Involved Advocacy Group, helped the family through the process.Raso, who is also a former vice principal for the TCDSB and worked in the Jane and Finch area for nearly 20 years, says the family was told by a TCDSB Superintendent that there was no virtual option. Raso says a lawyer working for the board emailed the family an alternative, which stated "there is likely a solution that would accommodate a learning model where the student attended 3 days in-person and 2 days virtually with 80% attendance in both."Thomas worries about the risk of Cuff getting the novel coronavirus on public transit or in a taxi. Having recently lost a grandmother to COVID-19, it's a big issue for the family and other people in their community.COVID-19 affects Black people and other people of colour disproportionately in Toronto, according to data gathered by the city. The figures show that's particularly true for those living in low-income areas. ICES, a non-profit research institute, reported the COVID positivity rate in the Jane and Finch area is more than 15 per cent, the seventh highest in the province.TCDSB must take boy's trauma into account, mentor saysAfter years in behavioural classes and special education, Nekeba ended up in the program following two suspensions. One incident was from a high school in North York where he threatened a teacher, and the second landed him a limited expulsion from Chaminade College School for stabbing a student in the leg in October.The most recent incident is still before the courts.Thomas says her son was remorseful but must take responsibility for his decisions."Right after that altercation, he took the shirt off his back to help the other student he hurt and wrapped it around his leg."Raso's been trying to help Cuff since he was in Grade 6 and has vouched for him to the board."I've watched this kid grow up. He's smart, he's funny and he's great in school when he can get support, but we need to provide more options for students dealing with serious trauma," he said.Trauma has followed the teen throughout his life, Raso says.Two weeks before the suspensions, Nekeba and his mother saw the immediate aftermath of a double homicide right outside their door. Nekeba looked out their window and saw two men on the ground bleeding. His mother actually placed the 911 call.Thomas says living through traumatic experiences like that shooting in October of last year, and the deaths of close friends, has severely affected her son's mental health and social abilities.Raso says no one from the school or the board ever called to check up on the teen after the shooting. And, he says, the board fails to factor in the trauma, or the dangers kids like Nekeba face when they're moved from one school to another."To send a kid from Jane and Finch who fears for his life because of the things he's experienced to a school just north of Regent Park, in another gang's territory, could be a matter of life and death even as a bystander," he said.Raso says that's the reason he left the TCDSB — he "couldn't take going to anymore students' funerals."When CBC News asked the Ministry of Education what it's doing to ensure the safety of students in communities such as Jane and Finch, the ministry responded that it's provided millions of dollars in additional funding to the area that could be used to hire more staff, students supports and pay for more technology. Next stepsRaso and the family got an appeal hearing with the TCDSB on Dec. 2 The TCDSB says school administrators and staff want to work with families to develop an appropriate student action plan and also to address any concerns they may have, but the family says they don't feel the board has done that.Thomas says they were contacted on Friday by the board with an offer for full time online learning but no formal intake meeting has taken place to discuss that option yet.She says she is taking the weekend to think about the meeting but questions the board's ability to help her son because she doesn't trust them.Thomas says her family will continue discussions for Cuff's education and perhaps help other students in the same situation.In the meantime, they have pulled Cuff from the TIPSS program and are seeking other options.They are now planning to file a human rights complaint against the TCDSB."Ultimately, we want to see kids in this board treated with dignity and respect in this program," Raso said.

But a couple of weeks into December, the display mysteriously went dark.When they investigated, the McCabes found the wires chewed through and several bulbs gone."We're trying to figure out what they're doing with the bulbs, because they cut the wire to both sides and we can't find them anywhere," Michael McCabe said.This year, thinking the squirrels had objected to the lights atop the fence because they interfered with their backyard "highway," the McCabes moved the lights to their back deck.But before December had even arrived, the rodents absconded with more bulbs — about $200 worth.A few houses down the street, Bob Porter has had the same costly problem."I just replaced the strings two days ago. Heaven forbid they chew them again," Porter said.Picky crittersThere are several theories about why the squirrels appear determined to stop Christmas from coming.Though the rascally rodents don't seem to favour any particular colour, they have indicated a preference for LED bulbs manufactured for Canadian retailers by the Chinese company Ting Shen — the very lights the McCabes began using last year.But at least one retailer said it's unaware of the problem."This is the first time we have received customer feedback about squirrels damaging Christmas lights," wrote Meghan Furman, a spokesperson for Home Hardware, where the McCabes purchased their lights. "We take all customer concerns seriously and are looking into this unusual incident."Porter purchased his Ting Shen-made lights, marketed under the Noma brand, from Canadian Tire."I feel their pain," said Bill Dowd, a former Ottawa 67's hockey player who started Skedaddle Humane Wildlife Control after hanging up his skates.Dowd's company also installs seasonal lights and is frequently called upon to replace bulbs that have been stolen by red squirrels.One theory suggests that the animals are drawn to the bulbs because they're tasty."Would you believe the plastic insulation that covers various electrical wires is soy-based?" police in Plainfield, Ill., posted online recently in an attempt to explain the phenomenon before citizens call to report the vandalism.Rodents have also been blamed for taste-testing the bioplastic insulation used in modern automotive wiring.WATCH | Squirrels rule the roost over family's festive decorations:Always experimenting"They're wired to try out new stuff," explained Ottawa naturalist Dan Brunton.But Brunton utterly rejects the theory that the rodents have been duped by either the flavour or shape of the bulbs."Nope. They'd know that after bite one," he said, explaining that the red squirrel's unique survival strategy is to constantly experiment, testing their environment for possible new food sources.Before humans, houses and plastics appeared on the landscape, it was a sound strategy."They're applying wild techniques to urbanized human landscapes, and sometimes it can be really weird. But sometimes it works to their advantage," Brunton said.The McCabes have had enough of the experimentation — they say that next year, they'll be keeping their Christmas lights inside the house. 22 hours ago CBC Highway 174 bridges dismantled this weekend for Stage 2 LRT Ottawa's light rail contractors will demolish two Highway 174 bridges this weekend so they can build Montreal station in the highway's median and start laying tracks out to Orléans.That will mean traffic will not be able to travel on Montreal Road under Highway 174 from 8 p.m. Friday to 7 a.m. on Monday, and detours will be in place. A shuttle will be available every five minutes for pedestrians.Highway 174's eastbound on-ramp from northbound Jeanne d'Arc Boulevard will close overnight Saturday, while the westbound on-ramp from southbound Champlain Street will close overnight Tuesday, Dec. 8.The big, year-end goal for the east-end LRT work has been to dismantle these bridges.Over the coming days, the decks will be chipped away, the girders and beams of the old bridge taken down, and the piers removed. In all, 1,456 cubic metres of concrete and 160 metric tonnes of steel will be taken down.Station construction to begin next yearMotorists will have noticed how crews with Kiewit and Vinci Group have been busy this year near that Montreal Road interchange. They've widened the highway, built seven new ramps, and moved traffic onto two new, outer bridges.In future, a "flyover" bridge will take trains from Blair station into the highway's median and out to Trim station. Construction of those tracks and Montreal station itself will begin next year, the mayor said."So we're going at a really fast clip folks, to make sure that these projects are ready," said Jim Watson at a rainy news event Friday afternoon.The $4.66 billion Stage 2 of light rail is set to open in stages. This five-station, 12-kilometre eastern extension of the electric Confederation Line, from Blair station to Trim, is scheduled to be finished by 2024.The western extension from Tunney's to Moodie, with its 11 stations, is set to open last in 2025. Kiewit and Vinci Group have been relocating sewers, culverts and other utilities, preparing for the cut-and-cover tunnel along Byron Avenue and a second tunnel under Connaught Avenue.The southern, diesel Trillium Line extension to Riverside South and the Ottawa International Airport is being built by SNC-Lavalin and is scheduled to open first, in 2022. 23 hours ago More Stories

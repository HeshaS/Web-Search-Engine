Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said last week it was apparent that transmissions weren't going down as they had hoped. She said that extending restrictions isn't a decision that she makes lightly or alone. Henry said they would look at all the options and will wait until today to make the decision. The infection rate last week swung from a low of 606 to a high of 827 cases, while the death toll during the same period did not dip below 11 per day. The health officer even updated restrictions late last week, suspending all indoor and outdoor sports for people 19 and over and stopping some high-intensity indoor group fitness classes like hot yoga and spin classes.

Saudi prince strongly criticizes Israel at Bahrain summit Latest Stories CBC The biggest wild card in U.S. politics now: Trump fans in Georgia They drove for hours to see Donald Trump this past weekend, then lined up for hours more, wearing Trump caps and T-shirts, chanting Trump chants, jeering various Trump's nemeses, and seething over an election they still insist was stolen from Trump.The decisions made by this same group of Georgia voters over the next few weeks could shape the course of American politics for the next few years. A pair of Jan. 5 elections in this state will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate, with registration closing Monday, and advance voting beginning next week.To hold the chamber, Republicans must win one of these two races; the outcome will affect future president Joe Biden's ability to confirm judges, appoint cabinet members and sign legislation.The concern for Republicans: Will these voters show up?The party's fortunes depend on turnout from what might be described as "Trump First" voters, those diehard supporters currently fuming at anybody they see as insufficiently loyal to the president.What has party brass concerned: the possibility these voters might stay home after the presidential election, disillusioned by Republican officials' refusal to help Trump overturn the result.The weekend rally in Georgia allowed for a timely temperature-taking of this powerful slice of the electorate.Very few people had signs for Republican senators Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue at the event, even though their re-election campaign was ostensibly the reason Trump flew in for an airport runway rally.When Loeffler and Perdue spoke, the crowd drowned them out with chants about the president like, "Stop the steal!" and, "Fight for Trump," a chorus of thousands of people making clear what truly stirs their political passions.Angry over Trump's lossSeated in the crowd, Pete Toole said he dislikes most politicians — that includes all Democrats and most Republicans.The one Republican he truly adores is Trump. And what matters to him right now is getting the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the presidential election result.He's not sure how, or on the basis of what legal arguments or evidence any of that could happen, but the retired grocer from the small town of Uvalda, Ga., just can't believe his man truly lost.He thinks other Republicans should be doing more to help Trump stay in office, and his disdain extends to the two Republican Senate candidates who were on that stage."I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. I'm for Trump," Toole said. "I don't like [Republican senators Kelly] Loeffler or [David] Perdue."Loeffler and Perdue are seeking re-election against Raphael Warnock, who is a pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King Jr. was co-pastor with his father, and Jon Ossoff, a former congressional staffer.Toole sees his party's candidates as weak and mealy-mouthed and said they need to be tough like Trump. When asked how, specifically, they should model their behaviour on the president's, he replied: "On everything. They should have his personality. Speak their mind."So what's the bottom line — will he turn out for the Senate run-offs or not? "I'm going to vote probably for Loeffler and Perdue."The reason: to stop the left from gaining power.WATCH | Could Trump's fraud claims keep Georgia voters home for run-off?:Trump lawyers urge boycottAnd that was the main takeaway from the vast majority of those interviewed at the rally by CBC News and other media during the weekend event.Most said that even if the presidential race mattered most to them, and even if they're unenthused by most Republicans, they would still turn out and cast ballots to help their party keep the Senate.There were exceptions.Lauren Voyles, who made a five-hour drive from north of Atlanta for the event, said she has lost faith in the electoral system. She thinks the vote was rigged against the president, despite the lack of evidence of electoral fraud.She singled out the so-called crooks, and the "fake-news media" and what she sees as the weak-kneed Republican establishment not fighting hard enough to keep Trump in the White House.When asked if she'll vote in the Senate race she said: "Not in the current system — why would I?"That dismissive attitude was echoed by angry Republicans who at a recent event shouted down the party chair, and by pro-Trump lawyers who urged a boycott of Senate races as a protest against a party establishment they deride as disloyal to the president.Stakes high for Democrats,tooSuch talk is sweet music to Democrats' ears.One Democrat who lives several hours north raised her hands in pretend prayer when asked if she expected rifts on the right to depress Republican turnout.Latresha Jackson, a volunteer with the Democratic Party near Atlanta, said her party badly wants those two seats, which would result in a 50-50 Senate tie and allow vice-president-elect Kamala Harris to cast tie-breaking votes."Democrats understand what's on the line," Jackson said, speaking at her home in Forsyth County.The head of the Democratic Party in that same county, Melissa Clink, said the party that retains the Senate doesn't just win more votes — its leadership controls the chamber agenda and decides which bills come up for a vote.All of which holds potential consequences on issues such as health care, climate change, infrastructure and immigration policy."Two years of gridlock" is how Clink described a Senate led by Mitch McConnell. "Right now, [McConnell is] the gatekeeper of what we even speak about on the floor."Her county branch began dropping off promotional flyers last weekend for the Jan. 5 vote, and progressive groups have mailed out applications for absentee ballots.Democrats must win both seatsDemocrats, however, have a taller hill to climb.While some recent polling gives Democrats an edge in what will likely be two close races, history and math are on the Republican side.For starters, Republicans only need to win one race to retain the advantage; Democrats need both. In addition, Republicans have a history of stronger turnout in run-off elections like these ones, which in Georgia are held after a general election when there are multiple candidates and nobody surpasses 50 per cent.In the last such run-off, in 2018, the Republican candidate for secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, expanded his wafer-thin general-election lead by more than 3 percentage points in the run-off.That's the same Brad Raffensperger who is now receiving death threats because he's in charge of running Georgia's elections, and he's refusing to help Trump overturn the result.Republican strategy: keep Trump in the conversationAfter the weekend Trump rally, it's now crystal-clear what the Republican strategy is in its effort to ensure turnout from Trump supporters.They're keeping Trump in the conversation.Several speakers at the weekend rally cast this Senate vote as a chance to cement the president's legacy and protect it from Democrats who would undo his tax, energy, climate, and other policies."Don't let them take [that legacy] away," said Sonny Perdue, a former Georgia governor, current Trump cabinet member, and cousin to one Republican candidate, Sen. David Perdue.Trump, for his part, delivered a long speech with three basic themes.First, he encouraged Republicans to turn out. He called this vote the most important congressional run-off in history, and lauded the two Senate candidates.Second, he trashed other Georgia Republicans. The bulk of Trump's speech consisted of grievances about the election, and complaints about the governor, who has refused to help him overturn the result.Finally, he also gave what sounded like a valedictory address. Trump concluded the speech by listing things his presidency achieved, from tax cuts to moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.Trump urged Georgians to cement that legacy by turning out for the Perdue and Loeffler: "These seats are the last line of defence to save America and protect all that we have accomplished."Not that Trump will ever admit defeat.Heated rhetoricNor will his supporters. They aren't just grumbling about an election loss; a large number appear to deeply believe he was robbed, based on a litany of unproven or disputed allegations now repeatedly dismissed in court.They're livid at the media for reporting he lost. A few screamed at a Fox News crew, while several shouted epithets at the media bus leaving the rally.Bob Kunst, who drove up from Miami for what he said was his 201st Trump-related event, said Republicans plan to unseat, in future primaries, anyone who fails to help Trump hold onto power.Some of the rhetoric, he said, is getting even more heated."This is like civil-war time," he said. "I am the most mild-mannered person. But I am way angry. … I've had people here tell me they're armed to the teeth."Yet he still cares about the Senate and wants Republicans to win. "They have to," Kunst said.Erick Erickson, a Georgia-based conservative radio show host who's been lukewarm on Trump — initially opposing him, then backing him, and often criticizing him — says he expects the party to unite for the Senate races.Erickson said a number of Republicans do care first and foremost about Trump but that there's also been a swift backlash to the talk about a boycott, and he expects Republicans will show up.He said history has also shown Georgia Republicans do turn out in non-presidential races, as they did in the 2018 midterm year."I think the GOP goes two for two [in the Senate races]," Erickson said in an interview outside his Atlanta studio."But it's gonna be a slugfest. Those of us in TV and radio — we're gonna come out the winners in this. … It's going to be close. Maybe closer than it should be." 10 hours ago The Canadian Press Double Dragons: SpaceX launches space station supplies CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — SpaceX launched a newer, bigger version of its Dragon supply ship to the International Space Station on Sunday, marking the first time the company has two capsules in orbit at the same time. The Dragon — packed with Christmas treats and presents — should reach the space station on Monday, joining the Dragon that delivered four astronauts last month. “Dragons everywhere you look,” said Kenny Todd, NASA’s deputy space station program manager. With NASA’s commercial crew program officially under way, SpaceX expects to always have at least one Dragon capsule at the space station. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket blasted off with the latest Dragon from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, where coronavirus precautions kept staff to a minimum. The first-stage booster — making its fourth flight — landed on an ocean platform several minutes after the late-morning liftoff. It was first used back in May for the first astronaut launch by Elon Musk's company. The 6,400-pound (2,900-kilogram) shipment includes billions of microbes and crushed asteroid samples for a biomining study, a new medical device to provide rapid blood test results for astronauts in space, and a privately owned and operated chamber to move experiments as big as refrigerators outside the orbiting lab. Forty mice also are flying for bone and eye studies, two areas of weaknesses for astronauts during long space stays. Todd said all this research is “the ultimate Christmas present” for NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, a virus hunter who performed the first DNA sequencing in space a few years ago. As for more personal presents for the four Americans, two Russians and one Japanese on board, “I don’t like to get out in front of Santa Claus. I fear it might mess up my own Christmas,” Todd said late last week. “Let’s see what happens when they open the hatch ... I’m optimistic.” For the astronauts' Christmas feast, the Dragon is carrying roasted turkey, cornbread dressing, cranberry sauce, shortbread cookies and tubes of icing. The station crew watched a live broadcast of the launch, from 250 miles (400 kilometres) up. This updated cargo-carrying model — as large as the SpaceX crew capsule — will dock to the orbiting lab by itself. Previous SpaceX cargo ships needed the station’s robot arm for anchoring. The capsule will remain at the space station for about a month as usual before undocking with experiments and old equipment, and splashing into the Atlantic. That’s another change from SpaceX’s older cargo ships, which parachuted into the Pacific. Returning closer to Cape Canaveral will save recycling time. This is SpaceX’s 21st station supply run for NASA since 2012. The flight was delayed a day by rough weather in the booster-recovery area offshore. This was the 68th successful booster landing by SpaceX. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

AdLearn The Principles of Prosperity Discover The Principles To Producing Wealth And Living The Life You Really Want… The Canadian Press Venezuela vote likely to give Congress to Maduro's party CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela's congressional election on Sunday will almost certainly give President Nicolás Maduro control over the country's last major independent institution, but will do little to improve his image at home and abroad.Maduro, who already has the loyalty of the courts, the military, prosecutors and other institutions, seeks to load the National Assembly with members of his United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Critics say he's guaranteed that by rigging the system to smother the last remnants of democracy in Venezuela.An opposition coalition led by U.S.-backed politician Juan Guaidó is boycotting the vote. The European Union, the U.S. and several other nations have already declared the vote a sham.“The truth cannot be hidden,” Guaidó said in a videotaped message, noting the apparent low voter turnout. “The majority of Venezuela turned its back on the fraud that began months ago.”Voting results were not available late Sunday several hours after the polls had closed.Despite Venezuela's political turmoil, voting took place with no apparent problems in Caracas, where polling places were operated by civilian militia members and armed soldiers alongside election workers.A light flow of voters walked up to ballot boxes at Andres Bello School in downtown Caracas. They checked their names on a wall outside, and inside showed identification cards before registering their votes on touchscreen machines, which printed a paper ballot they dropped into a box.“I came to vote, and in less than half a second I have voted, quickly,” Caracas resident Rafael Espinoza said. “I’ll tell anyone who wants to do so that they can come down and vote in fractions of a second.”The Supreme Court this year appointed a new elections commission, including three members who have been sanctioned by the U.S. and Canada, without participation of the opposition-led Congress, as the law requires.The court also removed the leadership of three opposition parties, appointing new leaders the opposition accuses of conspiring to support Maduro.Maduro has campaigned for his party's candidates — including his son and wife — promising to finally silence the right-wing opposition, which he accuses of inciting violent protests and inviting U.S. sanctions.“There are those who plot coups, those who ask for military intervention,” Maduro said on Saturday night in a broadcast on state television, dismissing criticism of the election. “We say: Votes yes -- war no, bullets no.”The election comes amid uncertainty over the impending change of U.S. administration. Like outgoing President Donald Trump, President-elect Joe Biden has called Maduro a “dictator," though it's unclear what approach he'll take toward Venezuela's crisis.Guaidó's opposition movement is holding its own referendum over several days immediately after the election. It will ask Venezuelans whether they want to end Maduro's rule and hold new presidential elections.Polls indicate that neither Maduro nor Guaidó are popular among Venezuelans at a time the nation's economic and political crisis is deepening despite having the world's largest oil reserves.Karol Teran, a nurse and single mother on her way to work in Caracas, said she didn't vote because it would have no impact. The election is controlled, she said.“I don’t feel like wasting my time, giving these people the opportunity, so I simply don’t vote,” she said. “We’re tired of all this. I’m tired of all of this. It’s not easy.”She was still considering whether to participate in the opposition's referendum.More than 5 million people have fled the country in recent years, the world’s largest migration after that of war-torn Syria. The International Monetary Fund projects a 25% decline this year in Venezuela’s GDP, while hyperinflation diminishes the value of its currency, the bolivar, now worth less than a millionth of a dollar on the free market.Maduro, the hand-picked successor to the late President Hugo Chávez, won a second term in 2018. But his political adversaries and scores of nations, including the U.S., reject his legitimacy, alleging the vote was rigged and his most popular challengers were banned.Guaidó, 37, vowed to oust 58-year-old Maduro early last year — basing his claim to the interim presidency on his leadership of the National Assembly, whose term legally ends in early January under the constitution.The Trump administration and other countries led support of Guaidó and have said they will continue to support him in the absence of what they consider fair elections.Washington has hit Maduro and his political allies with sanctions, and the U.S. Justice Department has indicted Maduro as a “narcoterrorist,” offering a $15 million reward for his arrest.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Sunday’s election was fraudulent.“The results announced by the illegitimate Maduro regime will not reflect the will of the Venezuelan people,” he said on Twitter. “What’s happening today is a fraud and a sham, not an election.”International bodies like the European Union have refused to send observers to Sunday’s election, saying the conditions for a democratic process don’t exist.Maduro’s government invited sympathetic international observers, former Presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador. Others included a group of men who identified themselves as Turkish lawmakers.At a polling place in Chacao, an opposition stronghold of Caracas, 68-year-old resident Luisa Fermin shouted at the observers, calling the election “theatrics” that she wouldn’t validate with her vote.“There are children who don’t go to school because they’re hungry,” Fermin said. “There are mothers who send their children to school barefoot because they don’t have the money to buy shoes.”___Follow Scott Smith on Twitter: @ScottSmithAP___Associated Press writers Fabiola Sánchez and Jorge Rueda contributed to this story.Scott Smith, The Associated Press 16 hours ago The Canadian Press Meng's lawyers fight on against extradition as reports swirl of proposed plea deal VANCOUVER — The legal fight against extradition to the United States for Meng Wanzhou is back on in a Vancouver court amid a report that the American Justice Department is discussing a deal in the case. A Wall Street Journal report says U.S. officials were discussing an agreement that would see the Huawei executive admit guilt to some of the allegations in exchange for dropping the extradition request. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wouldn't comment on the report Friday, except to say Canada's absolute priority is the safe release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, whose arrests and charges have been widely linked to Canada's detention of Meng. Lawyers for Meng are in B.C. Supreme Court today gathering evidence for an abuse of process claim they expect to make next year. Her lawyers have alleged officers with the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency hatched a plan to unlawfully search and interrogate her when she was arrested at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1, 2018. Meng and Huawei face charges in the United States over a claim they violated American sanctions against Iran — allegations that both deny. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 7, 2020. The Canadian Press 16 hours ago Local Journalism Initiative Studies link COVID-19 to a number of mental health disorders including depression Jan Willis found herself in Puerto Vallarta when COVID-19 was declared a worldwide pandemic in March. Before she could return to her native British Columbia, the 66-year-old was met with a flurry of cruise passengers, most of them sick with the virus. “I’m fairly certain that’s where I caught it,” Willis said. When she returned to her hometown of Victoria, her doctor told her to self-isolate immediately. Early on in the pandemic, there was no widespread testing and Willis was declared a presumptive case of COVID-19. Alongside physical symptoms, including lung issues, body pains and diarrhea, Willis also experienced psychiatric symptoms. The most severe, she said, was a hallucination she had of a cloud hanging above her a few weeks after her diagnosis, which then proceeded to enter her, causing a wave of sadness. “It was this absolutely profound depression that I’ve never experienced before,” Willis said. The sadness persisted, she said, and her mood continued to fluctuate even after she was declared free of the virus, prompting her doctor to prescribe antidepressants. Nine months later, she continues to be on the medication. Research shows Willis is not alone in experiencing depression symptoms after contracting COVID-19. A University of Oxford study, published in Lancet Psychiatry in November, revealed nearly one in five COVID-19 patients in the United States were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within 14 to 90 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis — many of whom had no history of mental illness. The data was obtained by examining the health records of 69 million patients in the U.S., 62,300 of whom had a COVID-19 diagnosis. Similar research has not been completed yet in Canada, but studies out of Italy and China reveal the same outcome: COVID-19 survivors have a higher chance of developing mental disorders in early stages of recovery. Researchers are left pondering, then, whether this is a result of trauma from contracting COVID-19, or is due to the virus’ ability to enter and alter the brain’s functions. This has prompted calls for longer-term studies on the topic. But Willis maintains her symptoms are more than virus fatigue. “I could feel the difference between what we’re all experiencing in terms of the pandemic, versus the biological [depression] that was happening to me that was out of control,” Willis said. It’s not beyond the realm of possibilities that COVID-19 could cause an array of psychiatric disorders, as there is a precedent of viruses causing neurological symptoms, said Roger McIntyre, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto. But McIntyre added it’s still not clear why patients are experiencing this outcome, although there are a few possible theories. “The virus itself may be directly toxic to the brain,” McIntyre said, adding the loss of taste and smell, a common COVID-19 symptom, suggests the virus can penetrate the brain. Another theory, he said, is the cytokine storm — caused by the body’s immune system going on overdrive in an attempt to fight the virus — can actually alter the brain’s functions. “Too much of the bad guy cytokines can actually cause mental illness,” McIntyre said. “They attack your brain.” Treatments for COVID-19 could also be a factor, he added. Steroids, which have been used to treat many COVID-19 patients, may inadvertently cause mental illness, McIntyre said. The possibility of COVID-19 being directly related to psychiatric disorders only adds to the swirl of uncertainty surrounding the virus, and few concrete answers are available on whether the trauma of experiencing the virus in the first place is also contributing to mental health concerns. Jane Cotman, a 58-year-old Mississauga woman, contracted the virus in March. But for her, the mental health symptoms seem to be more tied to the fatigue of having lingering physical symptoms of the virus itself. “My mental health suffers at times when I can’t pinpoint my pain or fatigue or shortness of breath,” Cotman said. “It’s a constant reminder that I am not yet back to being me.” Nine months later, Cotman continues to suffer from brain fog, extreme fatigue and insomnia with no answers as to why, despite being extremely healthy and active prior to falling ill with COVID-19, adding to her sense of worry and frustration. The symptoms highlighted in the University of Oxford research are different from the frequently documented “long hauler” COVID-19 symptoms of fatigue and brain fog, and are rather symptoms of depression, anxiety, dementia and post-traumatic stress disorder, McIntyre noted. But whatever the reason behind these symptoms might be, “it’s something that we now need to pay attention to,” McIntyre said. With so much uncertainty continuing to swirl around the virus and its effects, the psychiatric symptoms are an issue Willis said she would like doctors to especially be aware of. “We need to be listened to and understood,” said Willis, who is currently seeking counselling because of her experience with COVID-19. “You need that support, you need someone to say, ‘What do you need?’” An open letter published in the British Medical Journal in September, written by doctors who were sick with COVID-19 themselves, called for a multidisciplinary response to treating recovering patients and the creation of one-stop clinics where patients can access different types of care to combat long-term symptoms of their illness. It is an approach McIntyre echoed, adding a primary care provider and a team of specialists, which includes neurologists or psychiatrists, should be accessible to those recovering from COVID-19 as it has been proven to be a disease that affects an array of organs in the body. McIntyre said regardless of whether the virus is directly responsible for psychiatric disorders, the pandemic has proven to be “the greatest mental health assault on the general population ever recorded in humanity,” for social, economic and health reasons. “People are under chronic stress, and they don’t know when it’s going to end,” McIntyre said. It is imperative, then, that COVID-19 survivors are connected to mental health help and support, he said, whether it be through community clinics, online resources like the Canadian Mental Health Association, or their primary care provider. “A lot of people will be really perplexed because they won’t know this is all related, and they may feel even guilty for having these problems,” McIntyre said. But depression is treatable, McIntyre added, and COVID-19 survivors should not hesitate to reach out to a clinician if they feel its symptoms.

Animals at the farm are also being tested for the virus.In the meantime, the mink farm has been ordered to restrict the transport of animal, products and goods from the farm, the health authority statement said.In a statement, B.C.'s Agriculture Ministry said the outbreak is limited to one farm in the Fraser Valley. It said samples from some mink are being sent to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg for testing.Millions of minks were culled in Denmark last month after 11 people were sickened by a mutated version of the coronavirus that had been observed among the animals.The Danish government moved to cull all of Denmark's roughly 15 million minks, including healthy ones outside the northern part of the country where infections were found. It has also banned mink farming until the end of 2021.According to the World Health Organization, 214 human cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Denmark since June that have SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with farmed minks. The WHO bulletin says the minks were infected following exposure to infected humans. "Minks can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, passing the virus between them, and pose a risk for virus spill-over from mink to humans," said the report dated Nov. 6.It identified six countries that had reported SARS-CoV-2 in farmed minks, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Italy and the United States.Canadian mink farms In Canada, the highest numbers of fur farms are located in Nova Scotia, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, according to the Canada Mink Breeders Association.The association says 1.7 million farmed mink were produced in Canada in 2018, mainly in rural communities and the industry employs more than 60,000 Canadians. Mink farms in British Columbia are concentrated in the Fraser Valley, according to a 2014 B.C. Agriculture Ministry briefing.According to the statement from Fraser Health, WorkSafeBC has inspected the site and are working with the farm on its COVID-19 mitigation strategies.WorkSafeBC is also reaching out to other mink farms in B.C. to discuss their COVID-19 safety plans and measures to prevent transmission. 16 hours ago Initiative de journalisme local Parrainage civique: Entre amis, on se comprend! Le mouvement du parrainage civique a pris son envol dans la région il y a près de 40 ans. Encore de nos jours, il est à l’origine de grandes histoires d’amitié qui n’auraient autrement peut-être pas vu le jour. « Le parrainage civique, c’est la création d’une amitié entre deux personnes qui peuvent venir de deux milieux totalement différents, explique Julie Vachon, directrice de Parrainage civique de la Vallée-du-Richelieu. Il y en a généralement un qui a un travail, une famille, qui est intégré à la communauté alors que l’autre est un peu marginalisée par son handicap ou sa condition. » À titre d’exemples, M. Vachon évoque la déficience intellectuelle, les troubles du spectre de l’autisme et la trisomie 21. Afin de créer des liens, l’organisme, qui est sur le point de lancer une vaste campagne, organise des rencontres entre des êtres partageant des passions communes, que ce soit la musique, les activités extérieures, les animaux … ou le magasinage! « On invite souvent nos parrains et marraines potentiels à venir participer à une activité ou deux avec nous. Ça nous permet d’analyser, de voir les liens qui peuvent se créer naturellement entre deux personnes. » Bien entendu, les personnes recherchées présentent certaines caractéristiques qui font d’eux de bons partenaires potentiels pour les filleuls. « Nous avons une procédure, ajoute la directrice qui ne manque pas de faire l’éloge du personnel qui l’entoure. Il y a dix étapes à franchir avant d’officialiser un jumelage. Il ne faut pas oublier qu’il y a des personnes vulnérables. C’est pourquoi il est important pour nous de suivre un protocole qui nous assure que tout se fait dans le bon ordre et la sécurité. » Il est également important de se rappeler que, peu importe sa condition, l’ami bénévole s’adresse à un être adulte qui possède sa propre identité. « On s’adresse à eux de la même manière qu’on le ferait avec un ami proche. Il faut les accepter et les prendre pour des personnes à part entière. » Comme on peut s’y attendre, une telle démarche a permis de créer des liens solides qui perdurent depuis 5, 10 ou même 33 ans dans le cas d’un parrain de Marieville et son filleul de Chambly. Après tout ce temps, on peut considérer de facto qu’un ami fait aujourd’hui partie de notre famille à part entière. « Pour certains, l’autre devient comme un frère ou une sœur de cœur, une personne significative. Et il y en a pour qui c’est tout récent, mais qui ont vite créé une complicité. Après quelques rencontres, ils finissent déjà les phrases de l’autre! » Si la COVID-19 a rendu les rapprochements plus difficiles, le téléphone demeure une façon de garder la connexion bien vivante. D’autres ont continué de marcher ensemble tout en respectant les règles de la distanciation physique. « On entend souvent parler de « distanciation sociale », mais il y a une distinction qui est importante. Nous avons fait des activités cet été et tout le monde portait le masque. Au lieu de se donner la main, on se donnait un coup de coude! » Parfois, même quand des personnes doivent se retirer pour des raisons de santé notamment, l’attachement au mouvement demeure palpable au-delà des années passées auprès de l’organisme. « Nos bénévoles tiennent au parrainage civique en raison de sa mission, conclut Julie Vachon, grâce à la simplicité de la chose. On peut faire des activités à 2, 4, 10 ou même des soirées à 150 et ça demeure humain. La base, c’est de satisfaire le besoin de nos bénévoles et de nos filleuls. » Pour plus d’informations sur l’organisme, il suffit de visiter le: www.pcvr.ca Steve Martin, Initiative de journalisme local, La Relève 16 hours ago Ad•Hear.com Why this Ad?

CBC Police charge man with 2nd-degree murder after Bloordale Village altercation Police said they have charged a 30-year-old Toronto man with second-degree murder on Sunday after an altercation that sent another man to the hospital, where he later died.Toronto police said they were called to the intersection of Dufferin Street and Bloor Street West in the Bloordale Village at 4 a.m. on Saturday morning after they received reports that two men were involved in a verbal dispute that turned into a physical altercation.One of the men was knocked unconscious and was taken to the hospital in critical condition, said Const. Alex Li. The man later died in hospital, Li said.Li said police are asking any witnesses to come forward and are appealing to businesses in the area who may have security footage of the incident.The man charged is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. 17 hours ago The Canadian Press Deadline is up for COVID restrictions in B.C., although top doctor hints at extension VICTORIA — Provincewide COVID-19 restrictions are supposed to be lifted in British Columbia today, but there are indications that health officials will extend limits on events, sports and social gatherings. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said last week it was apparent that transmissions weren't going down as they had hoped.She said that extending restrictions isn't a decision that she makes lightly or alone.Henry said they would look at all the options and will wait until today to make the decision. The infection rate last week swung from a low of 606 to a high of 827 cases, while the death toll during the same period did not dip below 11 per day. The health officer even updated restrictions late last week, suspending all indoor and outdoor sports for people 19 and over and stopping some high-intensity indoor group fitness classes like hot yoga and spin classes.This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 7, 2020 The Canadian Press 16 hours ago CBC Shop local and shop small, business owners urge Toronto residents ahead of Christmas For vintage store owner Shauntelle LeBlanc, Christmas is the busiest time of year. Her store on the Danforth, Ethel 20th Century Living, sells everything from ornaments to jewelry, furniture to light fixtures, vases to candlesticks, and now is when customers want to buy.With Toronto in the province's grey lockdown zone, shopping is not allowed inside her store. LeBlanc says she has had to rely on curbside pickup, online shoppers and the e-commerce platform Shopify to keep her small business going."Shopping local is happening for us, definitely. This neighbourhood, Danforth and Woodbine, is really supportive of their small businesses," LeBlanc said. "The bigger challenge for us is to get people who don't shop local to start thinking that way."LeBlanc said it's not just about shopping local, it's about shopping small. She said people are used to going to big department stores and getting everything at once. They're not thinking about going to five different retailers, such as specialty stores, she said. "That's the shift that we need to push." Store owners across Toronto, including LeBlanc, are asking residents to get their Christmas gifts at local shops this year to help small businesses to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.Michelle Wasylyshen, spokesperson for the Retail Council of Canada, said the weeks before Christmas is a critical time for small business owners."With many businesses forced to closed in Toronto and Peel, it's more important than ever to support local merchants who work hard to bring main streets to life. Our local retailers have always been there for us and now it's our turn to be there for them. Every day counts," Wasylyshen said in a statement on Sunday.Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said many small retailers have reported that the six weeks before Christmas represent up to 40 per cent of annual sales. The CFIB urges Toronto residents to local, independent businesses whenever they can in the next three weeks because he said it will make a difference."Even in an ordinary year, the period leading up to Christmas is a critical time for small, local businesses," Kelly said in a statement on Sunday."But this year is even more critical. After nine incredibly challenging months of COVID, many small businesses saw the holiday shopping season as their last hope to keep their lights on and to build a bit of a reserve for the lean months expected in January, February and March," he added. "But the fresh retail lockdown of small business has dealt them a crushing blow by the Ontario government. Not only are they prevented from serving even a handful of customers in-store, but they're watching crowds of consumers lining up at big box stores where they can purchase the same kinds of non-essential goods."Small businesses 'doing their best' to serve customersKelly said small businesses, however, are making the best of the situation."Many small firms are doing their best to continue to serve customers while in-store options are unavailable. Thousands more small firms have started an e-commerce site over the past few months," he said.Kelly said if shopper cannot find their favourite business online, they should call them. "Many have created new options like curbside pickup, advice over the phone, or displaying their products over a live video call."Kelly estimates that one in seven small businesses are not expected to survive the pandemic. He said shopping decisions now can determine whether neighbourhood shops will survive when the pandemic ends.For Natalee Jannetta, co-owner of Good Intentions, a curated boutique and event space for small business, also on the Danforth, business has been good.In exchange for a membership fee, the store promotes and sells products of its members through its retail space and online store. Members have access to marketing resources and keep 100 per cent of their online and in-store sales. The store sells an "eclectic" mix, she said."We're definitely encouraging people to shop local," she said. "I would say, since the pandemic happened, people have started to realize the importance of shopping local. And that has been to our benefit."She said she and co-owner Epiphany Amba, a photographer, have been doing some Amazon comparisons on their social media sites.They have taken Amazon bestsellers and matched them with products carried in their store to show people that shopping local is easy and achievable if people are willing to put in the effort to do the research.Jannetta and Amba came up with a pandemic plan because the store opened on Nov. 1 when the second wave was underway. When the lockdown started, they introduced free delivery throughout the Golden Horseshoe. The store also has a sign that encourages window shopping and they have contactless payment method on the spot."I wouldn't say that we're struggling," Jannetta said.But she added of the lockdown: "I think it was neglectful, to be completely honest. This is the most crucial month of the year for retail, especially in the handmade and artisan small business community."Shows and markets have all been cancelled, she added.As for LeBlanc, she said online shopping and curbside pickup is more work. The inventory has to be put online. Then there is advertising and paperwork. People need to get used to shopping online. And what is lost in online shopping is impulse buying, she said."That's how we make our living, with the small stuff. I've always said with a shop like mine: 'I'm not paying my mortgage with sofas. I'm paying my mortgage with candlesticks,'" she said.She said she feels betrayed by the Ontario government, saying the lockdown should have been in October. Small businesses, unlike big box stores, do not have the luxury of planning long-term. "They could have done this better. We weren't prepared for this. We're suffering. But we're doing okay." 16 hours ago Ad•Amazon India Why this Ad? Ad Feedback Why don't you like this ad?

The school will close Monday and will remain shuttered at least until Dec. 14, she said.The board will provide more information once it has a firm date for students and staff to return, said Ure."I know this news will be concerning for our families and I want to thank you for you understanding during this difficult time. TPH has made a referral for school-wide testing and we will continue to provide any new information as soon as we receive it," she said. Classes will shift to remote learning. In a news release, TPH says it has advised students and staff in the affected cohorts to go into isolation.

Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a U.N. meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution. Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects. China's fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there. However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world. On Sunday, 1.2 million doses of the Chinese company Sinovac's vaccine arrived in Indonesia, the government said. "We are very grateful, thank God, the vaccine is now available so that we can immediately curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease,” President Joko Widodo said. Within China, so far only one developer, China National Pharmaceutical Group, known as Sinopharm, said in November it applied for final market approval for use of its vaccine. Others have been approved for emergency use on people deemed at high risk of infection. “We must be prepared for large-scale production,” Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said during a visit Wednesday to developers, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Sun, who has as overseen much of the country’s response, visited one of Sinopharm’s Beijing subsidiary companies, Sinovac and a research lab under the National Medical Products Administration, a regulatory agency that approves medical products for public use. The government has yet to say how many people it plans to vaccinate. Sun said plans call for vaccinating border personnel and other high-risk populations this month. The companies are using more traditional techniques than Western developers. They say unlike Pfizer's vaccine, which must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), theirs can be stored at 2 to 8 C (36 to 46 F). The Chinese producers have yet to say how they might be distributed. Health experts question why China is using experimental vaccines on such a vast scale now that the outbreak is largely under control within its borders. Health officials previously said China will be able to manufacture 610 million doses by the end of this year and ramp up to 1 billion doses next year. The government of Jiangsu province, where the major city of Nanjing is located, issued a procurement notice for vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm on Wednesday for emergency use. Authorities in Sichuan province in the west, which has about 85 million people, announced Monday they were already buying vaccines. An official newspaper in Anhui province, southeast of Beijing, said a local residential committee issued a notice asking whether residents want a vaccine. The Sichuan and Anhui announcements said the vaccine, given in two shots, would cost a total of 400 yuan ($60). Vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm were approved for emergency use in July. In October, Zhejiang province south of Shanghai offered the public vaccination under emergency use authorization. It said people considered high-risk would get priority. In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people had received its vaccine. In September, Sinovac's CEO said about 3,000 of its employees had taken their vaccine. He said the company provided tens of thousands of doses to the Beijing city government. Sinopharm has clinical trials under way in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina with nearly 60,000 volunteers. It has built two facilities in China capable of producing 200 million doses per year. Sinovac has trials in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. Its most recent publicized data, a study in the science journal the Lancet, showed its candidate produced lower levels of antibodies in people than those who had recovered from COVID-19. The company projects it will be able to produce a few hundred million doses of the vaccine by February or March of next year. Another producer, CanSino, is testing in Russia, Pakistan and Mexico and pursuing partnerships in Latin American countries. Its vaccine, which has been used on an emergency basis with the Chinese military, uses a harmless adenovirus to carry genes into human cells to generate an immune response. A fourth company, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biologic Pharmacy Co., is conducting final stage trials across China. ___ Associated Press video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this report. Huizhong Wu, The Associated Press 17 hours ago The Canadian Press Biden picks Calif. AG Becerra to lead HHS, pandemic response WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden has picked California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to be his health secretary, putting a defender of the Affordable Care Act in a leading role to oversee his administration's coronavirus response.Separately, Biden picked a Harvard infectious disease expert, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.If confirmed by the Senate, Becerra, 62, will be the first Latino to head the Department of Health and Human Services, a $1-trillion-plus agency with 80,000 employees and a portfolio that includes drugs and vaccines, leading-edge medical research and health insurance programs covering more than 130 million Americans.Biden's selection of Becerra was confirmed by two people familiar with the decision, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement anticipated Tuesday.Two people also anonymously confirmed the choice of Walensky. The post of CDC director does not require Senate confirmation.Becerra, as the state of California's top lawyer, has led the coalition of Democratic states defending “Obamacare” from the Trump administration's latest effort to overturn it, a legal case awaiting a Supreme Court decision next year.A former senior House Democrat, Becerra was involved in steering the Obama health law through Congress in 2009 and 2010. At the time he would tell reporters that one of his primary motivations was having tens of thousands of uninsured people in his Southern California district.Becerra has a lawyer's precise approach to analyzing problems and a calm demeanour.But overseeing the coronavirus response will be the most complicated task he has ever contemplated. By next year, the U.S. will be engaged in a mass vaccination campaign, the groundwork for which has been laid under the Trump administration. Although the vaccines appear very promising, and no effort has been spared to plan for their distribution, it’s impossible to tell yet how well things will go when it’s time to get shots in the arms of millions of Americans.Becerra won't be going it alone. Biden, who is expected to announce key health care picks as early as Tuesday, is taking a team approach to his administration's virus response.Businessman Jeff Zients is expected to be named as Biden's White House coronavirus co-ordinator. An economic adviser to former President Barack Obama, Zients also led the rescue of the HealthCare.gov website after its disastrous launch in 2013. And former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, a co-chair of Biden’s coronavirus task force, is expected to return in a new role akin to the top medical adviser.But the core components of HHS are the boots on the ground of the government’s coronavirus response. The Food and Drug Administration oversees vaccines and treatments, while much of the underlying scientific and medical research comes from NIH. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention takes the lead in detecting and containing the spread of diseases. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provides insurance coverage for more than 1 in 3 Americans, including vulnerable seniors, as well as many children and low-income people.Under President Donald Trump, CDC was relegated to a lesser role after agency scientists issued a stark early warning that contradicted Trump’s assurances the virus was under control, rattling financial markets. The FDA was the target of repeated attacks from a president who suspected its scientists were politically motivated and who also wanted them to rubber-stamp unproven treatments.As CDC director, Walensky would replace Dr. Robert Redfield, who accurately told the public coronavirus vaccines would not be available for most people until next year, only to be disparaged by Trump as “confused.” Walensky is a leading infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, and has devoted her career to combatting HIV/AIDS.Becerra’s experience running the bureaucratic apparatus of the California attorney general's office, as well as his success working with Republicans, helped seal the pick for Biden, said a person familiar with the process but not authorized to comment publicly. Becerra had worked with Louisiana’s Republican attorney general to increase the availability of the COVID-19 drug treatment Remdesivir in their states. He’s also worked closely with other Republican attorneys general on legal challenges against opioid manufacturers.Early in California’s coronavirus response, Becerra defended broad shutdowns Gov. Gavin Newsom had put in place to curtail the pandemic, including limits on religious gatherings. Three churches in Southern California had sued Newsom, Becerra and other state officials because in-person church services had been halted.Biden's offer was extended to Becerra on Friday. The president-elect has been under pressure from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to appoint Latinos to the Cabinet.Becerra has been jokingly known in Democratic legal circles as the man who sued Trump more than anyone else. Beyond health care, the California attorney general's lawsuits centred on issues from immigration to environmental policies.Previously Becerra had served for more than a decade in Congress, representing parts of Los Angeles County.

In Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., Chuck Gruben's truck wasn't having it. "I started to back out of the driveway and I started going sideways," he told Wanda McLeod on CBC's Northwind. The thermostat hit zero degrees in the hamlet on Thursday, balmy for this time of year, when the average high is around -20 C. But Tuktoyaktuk's temperatures were frigid compared with other communities in the territory. Norman Wells hit a tropical 11.1 C — smashing its previous record-high for December of 5.7 C, set in 1985. Wrigley also hit 11 degrees Thursday, while Fort Simpson, Sambaa K'e and the South Slave region all saw temperatures above zero. "It's not normal," said Gruben, commenting on the heavy rain he was seeing in Tuktoyaktuk. Bradlyn Oakes/CBC He said conditions were slippery and many people stayed home. "Even to get down your steps, it's pretty scary," he said. "My wife, she went out to her work truck this morning. She had to sit on the steps and go down each step on her bum." The unusually warm weather may be even harder on the animals. "For any animals or birds that forage out there, it's going to be hard to dig for food once it freezes," said Gruben. While temperatures in Tuktoyaktuk are forecasted to descend into the minus-teens and twenties over the weekend, these recent days of rain and warmth might not be forgotten by the caribou. "These are the kind of winters that we dread for the caribou," said Gruben, especially considering how animal numbers are declining. "This just contributes to make it worse for them," he said. "Going to see a lot of skinny caribou." TRENDING 1. The water has been bridged: COVID-19 cases on the rise on Vancouver Island 2.

What's the latest?Ottawa reported 48 of the province's record-setting 1,859 newly confirmed cases on Saturday. Meanwhile, western Quebec saw 47 more cases and two more deaths. The region has reported 3.687 cases and 85 deaths since the start of the pandemic.The Eastern Ontario Health Unit reported a record number of new COVID-19 cases in the community on Friday, a top official said, adding 43 more people to the region's list of confirmed positive cases.How many cases are there?As of Saturday, 8,701 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in Ottawa. There are 384 known active cases, 7,938 resolved cases and 379 deaths linked to COVID-19.Public health officials have reported more than 14,400 COVID-19 cases across eastern Ontario and western Quebec, including more than 12,900 resolved cases.Ninety people have died of COVID-19 elsewhere in eastern Ontario, along with 85 in western Quebec. CBC Ottawa is profiling those who've died of COVID-19. If you'd like to share your loved one's story, please get in touch.What can I do?Both Ontario and Quebec are telling people to limit close contact only to those they live with, or one other home if people live alone, to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Ontario says this will apply through December's holidays, with people who live away from home such as post-secondary students asked to reduce close contacts for 10 to 14 days before going back.Travel from one region to another is discouraged throughout the Outaouais.Ontario says people shouldn't travel to a lower-level region from a higher one and some lower-level health units want residents to stay put to curb the spread.Ottawa is currently in the orange zone of Ontario's five-colour pandemic scale, which allows organized gatherings and restaurants, gyms and theatres to bring people inside.The city's medical officer of health said on CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning Thursday the COVID-19 decline has stabilized and Ottawa won't be moving to yellow on Ontario's pandemic scale next week.Three other eastern Ontario health units are under yellow zone restrictions: * The Eastern Ontario Health Unit. * Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington (KFL&A) Public Health. * Hastings Prince Edward Public Health.That means restaurant hours, table limits and rules around capacity fall somewhere between those in place in Ottawa and the rest of eastern Ontario, which is currently green, the lowest level.In Gatineau and the surrounding area, which is one of Quebec's red zones, health officials are asking residents not to leave home unless it's essential.There is no indoor dining at restaurants and gyms, cinemas and performing arts venues are all closed.The rest of western Quebec is orange, which allows private gatherings of up to six people and organized ones up to 25 — more in seated venues.Its rules won't be loosened until mid-January at the earliest.What about schools?There have been about 200 schools in the wider Ottawa-Gatineau region with a confirmed case of COVID-19:Few have had outbreaks, which are declared by a health unit in Ontario when there's a reasonable chance someone who has tested positive caught COVID-19 during a school activity.Distancing and isolatingThe novel coronavirus primarily spreads through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, breathes or speaks onto someone or something. These droplets can hang in the air.People can be contagious without symptoms.This means people should take precautions such as staying home when sick, keeping hands and frequently touched surfaces clean, socializing outdoors as much as possible and maintaining distance from anyone they don't live with — even with a mask on.Ontario has abandoned its concept of social circles.Masks are mandatory in indoor public settings in Ontario and Quebec and should be worn outdoors when people can't distance from others. Three-layer non-medical masks with a filter are recommended.Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate, as should those who've been ordered to do so by their local public health unit. The duration depends on the circumstances in both Ontario and Quebec.Anyone who has travelled recently outside Canada must go straight home and stay there for 14 days.Health Canada recommends older adults and people with underlying medical conditions and/or weakened immune systems stay home as much as possible. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?COVID-19 can range from a cold-like illness to a severe lung infection, with common symptoms including fever, a cough, vomiting and the loss of taste or smell. Less common symptoms include chills, headaches and pink eye. Children can develop a rash.If you have severe symptoms, call 911.Mental health can also be affected by the pandemic and resources are available to help.Where to get testedIn eastern Ontario:Anyone seeking a test should book an appointment.Ontario recommends only getting tested if you have symptoms, or if you've been told to by your health unit or the province.People without symptoms, but who are part of the province's targeted testing strategy, can make an appointment at select pharmacies.Ottawa has nine permanent test sites, with mobile sites wherever demand is particularly high.Local city councillor Mathieu Fleury says Vanier is getting a COVID-19 test site.Kingston's test site is at the Beechgrove Complex. The area's other site is in Napanee.People can arrange a test in Bancroft and Picton by calling the centre or Belleville and Trenton online.The Eastern Ontario Health Unit has sites in Alexandria, Cornwall, Hawkesbury, Limoges, Rockland and Winchester. The Limoges site closes Dec. 11 and reopens in Casselman Dec. 14.The Leeds, Grenville and Lanark health unit has permanent sites in Almonte, Brockville, Kemptville and Smiths Falls and a mobile test site visiting smaller communities.Renfrew County residents should call their family doctor or 1-844-727-6404 for a test or with questions, COVID-19-related or not. Test clinic locations are posted weekly.In western Quebec:Tests are strongly recommended for people with symptoms or who have been in contact with someone with symptoms.Outaouais residents can make an appointment in Gatineau seven days a week at 135 blvd. Saint-Raymond or 617 avenue Buckingham.They can now check the approximate wait time for the Saint-Raymond site.There are recurring clinics by appointment in communities such as Gracefield, Val-des-Monts and Fort-Coulonge.Call 1-877-644-4545 with questions, including if walk-in testing is available nearby.First Nations, Inuit and Métis:Akwesasne had its most known COVID-19 cases of the pandemic in November.

"Obviously I'm very excited, who wouldn't want to have a famous animal?" said Gallant. "I think he deserves all the hype."Gallant got Reznor when he was less than six weeks old. He's always been unusual in that he is polydactyl — he has extra toes that resemble thumbs. He's also part munchkin, a feline breed with shorter legs.Personality-wise, he is "very dramatic," she said, and loves attention. The two are inseparable. He'd always been popular with her friends and family, and Gallant had made some Instagram posts featuring Reznor, but he didn't even crack 1,000 followers on the platform. Then the pandemic hit and many people downloaded the TikTok app, which features mostly lighthearted short dance and lipsync videos. It's even launched some stars — like Reznor. 'Perfect cat storm' "A lot of people had more free time, I guess you could say, during quarantine," Gallant said. "I always told myself I would never go on TikTok, I thought it was for the younger generation, but my friends kind of got into it then so did I, and I started noticing there was a big area there for cats." Gallant began posting videos of herself and her three cats, but it was the videos of Reznor that took off. "I guess I must have hooked on to that cat community, or cat TikTok as they call it," she said. It was a "perfect cat storm, he must just have what everybody likes. Friends start tagging each other and then people start making requests and I start fulfilling those requests, so it's more of an interactive thing and I think his fans and followers really like that."Requests come from all over the world to give Reznor a "boop" or tap on the nose. People in Italy, France, Australia, Lebanon, Armenia, Ethiopia, Russia and dozens of other countries ask Gallant to boop or pat Reznor for them if they are having a bad day, taking exams, recovering from surgery or just because he is "so cute!" They also want to see closeups of his extra toes, or watch Gallant dressing him in a variety of clothes such as sweaters and a Santa outfit. He has an Amazon wish listThat her cat suddenly has followers all around the globe is a bit surreal, Gallant said, when she steps back and thinks about it."It feels extremely weird. And I don't even like calling them followers, because even that sounds weird to me — I like to call them his friends, really, because they're very sweet people. They give me advice, they're just kind in general for the most part, and they love sending him gifts."Oh yes, the gifts. Sweaters and beds and treats and toys and outfits and dishes, all sent by complete strangers. > Sometimes it does get to be a bit much. — Erin Gallant"He has an Amazon wish list," Gallant said. "His friends were asking ... can we send him things?" She set up an online wish list, because she didn't feel comfortable making her address public, she said."It's a pretty genius idea really," she said. When Reznor gets packages, Gallant said her three-year-old daughter can get a little jealous, so she involves the toddler by getting her to open the gifts and give them to Reznor. The family has two other cats that enjoy sharing his wealth — Reznor's "wife" Stevie Nicks who is another ginger tabby, and Tucker, the black-and-white tuxedo cat. Tucker is also becoming popular on TikTok, Gallant said, and people are asking for more videos of him. He is handsome but more reserved than Reznor. Gallant said she'll consider it in the future, but right now keeping up with Reznor's account keeps her quite busy."It has become a part-time job," she said. She posts 10 to 15 short videos some days, with usually two or three of those videos going viral. "I'm considering making Sunday a no-post day. Sometimes it does get to be a bit much."She has told her neighbours what she's doing, she said, "so I don't feel as ridiculous when I'm out in my yard, sometimes in my pyjamas, filming my cat!" What's a star without merch?Besides buying Reznor gifts, Gallant said as soon as he started to become famous, his fans began asking daily for Reznor-branded merchandise. So Gallant obliged."I don't know anything about that, so I asked for help," Gallant said. She found a website where she said creating merchandise with Reznor's image on it was easier than she thought. > A lot of people want the Reznor plushy, and I don't blame them, he's a pretty squishy guy. — Erin GallantShe said people have been enjoying purchasing T-shirts, hoodies, mugs, stickers, face masks and more."We're doing pretty good, not going to retire on it but it's really interesting, we're having a lot of fun doing it," she said. They have had many requests for Reznor calendars and Reznor plush toys, which are next on her list to research and design. "A lot of people want the Reznor plushy, and I don't blame them, he's a pretty squishy guy," she said. "People have been saying forever, 'Reznor needs to earn his keep.' I think he's doing a great job!" Although he is almost 14 now, Gallant said Reznor's health is very good. She takes him out in her yard for supervised walks and he has regular vet visits. "He's not slowing down any — he is a little bit chonkier, we are watching his weight," she said. More from CBC P.E.I. 21 hours ago Ad•Hear.com Why this Ad? Ad Feedback Why don't you like this ad?

Reuters U.S. considering blacklist for Yemen's Houthis: Oman foreign minister Oman's foreign minister said on Saturday the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East had discussed with his country the possibility of Washington designating Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement as a terrorist group. "Yes, that was raised," Sayyed Badr Al Busaidi told a Bahrain summit in response to a question on whether the potential blacklisting had been broached by David Schenker during a recent visit to Muscat. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration had threatened to blacklist the Houthi movement, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen since 2015. 22 hours ago CBC Residents fear 'canyon of condos' on Kingston Road but planners say more density needed As the pace of development along Kingston Road in the city's east end intensifies, people who live in communities along the old Highway 2 worry it will become a "canyon of condos" and spoil existing neighbourhoods.Already, Karen Azucar says development pressures have already cost her her home in an area of southwest Scarborough called Birch Cliff."I love where I live. I'm a big part of my community. I have a salon nearby," said Azucar, who moved into Lenmore Court, a complex with three low-rise apartment blocks close to the lake on Kingston Road just west of Birchmount Road, five years ago.The owner of Salon O found out a few weeks ago that the buildings would be torn down and replaced by a nine-storey condominium tower. She's upset news of the"demoviction" came in the middle of a pandemic."I had just re-opened my salon and I was trying to get back into business after not working for three months and I just can't deal with this right now."The developer and local councillor say the project is in its early stages and open to community input. A meeting is planned for next week.It's just the latest example of redevelopment moving outward from the core as neighbourhoods along Kingston Road become desirable places to live. The city's official plan encourages intensification — building denser, more heavily populated neighbourhoods with more condo complexes and apartment buildings — along such major arterial roads.As a result, there are dozens of projects along the road in various stages of planning, approval and construction as the city has designated "urban growth centres" along such intensification corridors.John Hartley has lived in The Beach area for four decades, but five years ago, he bought a home on picturesque Lakeside Drive. which begins at Kingston Road and ends at Lake Ontario. He plans to fight the plan to build a nine-storey condo complex steps from his front door."It's an attack on my home, plain and simple," said Hartley, who believes the COVID-19 pandemic has put arguments for intensification to the test as people are moving out from the downtown core."Putting in another 265 units on top of the 6,000 already proposed for Kingston Road, it's just a failure of planning."Frank Clayton, a senior research fellow at Ryerson University's Centre for Urban Policy and Land Development, recently reviewed how pre-zoning areas for intensification can help speed up the supply of needed housing.And he also used to have an office not far from Lenmore Court."Cities have to grow. And they have to grow up or out," said Clayton.He said Kingston Road is ripe for redevelopment. It had been the major eastern route in and out of Toronto to Kingston and Montreal before Highway 401 was built in the 1960's It's still a way tens of thousands of commuters get to and from downtown."Even with a pandemic there's a huge demand for housing, but with development there's a huge lag," he said. "If supply doesn't respond to demand, prices go through the roof."Urban planners like Clayton prefer what they call "densification" to sprawl. They say it encourages walking and cycling to work, public transit, safety, and energy efficiency, whereas building more suburban subdivisions leads to more car use, consumption of fossil fuels, pollution and the paving over of valuable farmland and green space.The push for more density is the reason more condos are getting built outside the downtown core, and why the mid-rise boom in Leslieville and The Beach is rippling outward along Kingston Road and Queen Street East.Clayton says height and density are dictated by the costs of the project, not community demands. He says heights of eight and 10 storeys are not unreasonable along Kingston Road."It can't be just what the local community wants.It's got to be a combination of what works from a development perspective, the developer can make money on, because they always want to make money, and they provide housing."But those in the community worry about what it will look like if developers have free rein."It's absolutely going to be a canyon of condos. They are too dense, too wide and too high," said Anna Dewar Gully of the Birch Cliff Village Community Association.She points to the Kingston Road Revitalization Plan, unveiled in 2010 in which the city agreed to limit building heights for much of the area from Birchmount Road to Warden Avenue to between four and six storeys, "There just seems to be a foregone conclusion that if developers want more density then what's in the plan that was carefully consulted on in this community ... we are going to defer to that need to make tons of money." 21 hours ago CBC Highway 174 bridges dismantled this weekend for Stage 2 LRT Ottawa's light rail contractors will demolish two Highway 174 bridges this weekend so they can build Montreal station in the highway's median and start laying tracks out to Orléans.That will mean traffic will not be able to travel on Montreal Road under Highway 174 from 8 p.m. Friday to 7 a.m. on Monday, and detours will be in place. A shuttle will be available every five minutes for pedestrians.Highway 174's eastbound on-ramp from northbound Jeanne d'Arc Boulevard will close overnight Saturday, while the westbound on-ramp from southbound Champlain Street will close overnight Tuesday, Dec. 8.The big, year-end goal for the east-end LRT work has been to dismantle these bridges.Over the coming days, the decks will be chipped away, the girders and beams of the old bridge taken down, and the piers removed. In all, 1,456 cubic metres of concrete and 160 metric tonnes of steel will be taken down.Station construction to begin next yearMotorists will have noticed how crews with Kiewit and Vinci Group have been busy this year near that Montreal Road interchange. They've widened the highway, built seven new ramps, and moved traffic onto two new, outer bridges.In future, a "flyover" bridge will take trains from Blair station into the highway's median and out to Trim station. Construction of those tracks and Montreal station itself will begin next year, the mayor said."So we're going at a really fast clip folks, to make sure that these projects are ready," said Jim Watson at a rainy news event Friday afternoon.The $4.66 billion Stage 2 of light rail is set to open in stages. This five-station, 12-kilometre eastern extension of the electric Confederation Line, from Blair station to Trim, is scheduled to be finished by 2024.The western extension from Tunney's to Moodie, with its 11 stations, is set to open last in 2025. Kiewit and Vinci Group have been relocating sewers, culverts and other utilities, preparing for the cut-and-cover tunnel along Byron Avenue and a second tunnel under Connaught Avenue.The southern, diesel Trillium Line extension to Riverside South and the Ottawa International Airport is being built by SNC-Lavalin and is scheduled to open first, in 2022. 23 hours ago Ad•Raging Bull Why this Ad?

CBC A tourism industry in 'survival mode' looks ahead to an uncertain recovery There isn't a hint of overstatement when Mark McCarthy calls 2020 a lost year for the Canadian tourism industry."Everyone is on survival mode," said McCarthy, whose family-owned tourism company in St. John's did a fraction of its usual business this past summer after premiers in the Atlantic provinces created a regional bubble that excluded visitors from the rest of the country.McCarthy and Joe Urie, co-owner of the Jasper Tour Company in Alberta, spoke to CBC's The House about the common challenges their industry faces because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the aid package included in this week's fiscal update provides enough of a booster shot to inoculate them against another round of economic lockdowns.Tourism employs 750,000 people in Canada, accounts for 2 per cent of GDP and supports many rural and Indigenous communities.Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland acknowledged the sector took a particularly heavy blow from the prolonged economic lockdown, from politicians at all levels urging people to stay home and from travel restrictions that remain in place in many parts of the country."We know that businesses in tourism, hospitality, travel, arts and culture have been particularly hard-hit. So we are creating a new stream of support for those businesses that need it most … that have lost revenue as people stay home to fight the spread of the virus," Freeland said in French while presenting Monday's economic update.WATCH: Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland delivers fiscal updateThe government created a program offering guaranteed loans and reduced interest rates to the tourism sector and other hard-hit industries. It also moved this week to earmark 25 per cent of its Regional Relief and Recovery Fund for local tourism businesses. That works out to more than $500 million through June.McCarthy and Urie have never met, but they face the same daunting challenges in keeping their businesses afloat and their people employed.McCarthy's company typically runs 50 escorted tours around Newfoundland and Labrador during the peak season from May to October. Its customers are mostly Canadian, its tours employ local guides and its spinoff business helps to support local restaurants, shops and car rental firms."However, after March, when everything closed down, basically we had no season at all," McCarthy said. "We ended up with less than one per cent of revenue for the year."Urie takes groups of up to 14 people on tours in and around Jasper National Park that focus on Indigenous history and culture. Unlike McCarthy, he relies heavily on international travellers."And of course, with the borders closed, that pretty much zeroed us out," Urie told The House. "And, like Newfoundland being closed, the Canadian federal government closed the national parks and the national historic sites across the country. So we didn't even have — for almost a three-month period of time — Albertans coming into the park."The near-collapse of tourism made it impossible for many companies to keep all of their employees on the payroll. With no tourists, with no money coming in, federal programs like the wage subsidy were of limited use to these firms.Do more, industry tells OttawaThe Tourism Industry Association of Canada said it's encouraged by the support targeting the industry in this week's fiscal update, but warned that more needs to be done if these companies are to survive."Tourism businesses have been facing months of reduced or no revenue — and without certainty of support, including timing, they cannot plan for their financial future," said the association's acting CEO Vince Accardi in a statement. "We look forward to continued work with the government to ensure these supports get to those who have been hardest hit, on the right terms and as soon as possible."Urie said Indigenous companies face additional burdens."A lot of Indigenous tourism businesses have a really hard time applying for these programs. There's a lot of financial institutions that won't touch you if your business is on a reserve," he said. "You know, it's really, really difficult."No recovery until 2022, says UrieUrie estimates it will take until at least 2022 — perhaps longer — for tourism to rebound, despite reports that vaccines will be available in Canada in the coming months. He said that's made him reluctant to apply for the federal business loans.McCarthy has similar concerns about the plight of his partners in small communities around Newfoundland and Labrador who might be attracted by the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA), which provides interest-free loans of up to $60,000. A third of a CEBA loan will be forgiven if the balance is paid off by the end of 2022."And unless we can get opened up in 2021, I think that the payback period could be difficult for a lot of these operators," he said. "So I think it's a real concern for people who are just availing of the loans ... because they're in survival mode."As their interview with The House ended, Urie and McCarthy exchanged information. "I just went on your site and had a look, Joe. It's great!" McCarthy said as he and Urie briefly chatted about the value of private tours and engaging more with local guides."We're on the same page," Urie replied.On the same page — and in the same boat, as they look ahead to an uncertain future for Canada's tourism industry. 23 hours ago CBC Canada to ease immigration rules for Hong Kongers. The move couldn't come fast enough for these B.C. students Hong Kong natives Tim Chan and Maggie Tong have enjoyed the time they've spent studying and living in British Columbia — but, until recently, they had never thought of settling in Canada after graduation.Chan, now in his final year of a sociology major at the University of Victoria, had originally planned to start his career in Hong Kong, where Tong has already returned to finish a degree in social work after six months as an exchange student in B.C.But the Chinese government's ongoing crackdown on the semi-autonomous region's civil liberties since June 2019 has completely changed their plans. The pair, who have been dating for two years, now feel their home city has no future for them."It is so hard [for me] to watch Hong Kong die," said 23-year-old Chan, referring to the growing increase in suppression of dissent there."Now I'm quite sure I'll leave," said Tong, 21, speaking in Cantonese.Chan and Tong, along with other final-year students and recent graduates from Hong Kong, are hopeful they can settle permanently in Canada after Ottawa announced new immigration measures on Nov. 12 that will make it easier and quicker for them to settle here.Canada is seeing a surge in interest from potential immigrants from the region through the number of study permit applications and skilled worker applications as political unrest in Hong Kong continues. Many young residents are at odds with their government over the erosion of freedoms that were guaranteed after the region returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and a high-profile activist was this week sentenced to 13 months in prison for his role in pro-democracy protests last year.WATCH | Pro-democracy protester jailed in Hong Kong:Exact details of the new immigration pathways, which will be launched in the new year, have yet to be announced.But in an email to CBC News, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) said under its new measures, Hong Kong citizens who have graduated from a Canadian post-secondary institution will be able to apply for permanent residency without any work experience. A three-year work permit program will also be available for Hong Kong graduates of both Canadian and non-Canadian institutions over the past five years. Under existing immigration rules, Chan and Tong would have to apply for permanent residency via the federal skilled worker program or provincial nominee program — a process that could potentially take years because they do not have work experience.As well, coming to Canada as a skilled worker or investor has become increasingly competitive. Such applications more than doubled between 2015 and 2019, from 407 to 948, according to IRCC.Meanwhile, Canada has seen a surge in study permit applications from Hong Kong. IRCC figures show 1,991 such applications were received from the region as of Sept. 30 — higher than any number for a full year since at least 2015.Fears of crossing China's 'red line'Chan says he has good reason to stay in Canada. He did his internship in Hong Kong last year with a pro-democracy politician and fears this experience may stall his career should he choose to develop it at home. Since China's top legislature implemented a national security law in July, numerous pro-democracy lawmakers, activists and protesters in Hong Kong have been arrested."You never know what time that [internship experience] will be my black mark in my life," Chan said."In Canada, I don't worry about it [political censorship], because Canada is [an] open society."Canada supports the right to peaceful protest, and those people who are arrested for actions that are not considered criminal in Canada will not be denied entry to this country, IRCC says in its Nov. 12 statement on new immigration pathways for Hong Kong youth.Like Chan, Tong worries that if she becomes a registered social worker in Hong Kong, she may lose her professional qualification if she counsels youngsters who participate in civil disobedience movements.Her concern stems from an incident in October, when the Hong Kong government stripped a primary school teacher of his licence after he discussed the region's independence in classes.According to the national security law, promoting separatism is criminal."It's getting easier to cross the 'red line,'" Tong said. "I don't feel safe working in Hong Kong."Tong says she and several of her University of Hong Kong classmates are planning to emigrate to Canada via the new three-year work permit program. When the permit expires, these applicants can either extend the permit or apply for permanent residency, IRCC said.Tong has two more options toward becoming a permanent resident: She can have Chan sponsor her as a partner, or apply to study for a postgraduate degree. She's considering a master's degree in social work at the University of British Columbia, which she thinks would help her get a job.While UBC doesn't provide data on graduate program applications, the university's Vancouver and Okanagan campuses have, respectively, seen a 66 per cent and 32 per cent jump from last year in undergraduate applications from Hong Kong students who are neither Canadian citizens nor permanent residents.Michelle Suderman, UBC's director of international student development, says Hong Kong students need not worry too much about not having the minimum English proficiency or grade average to fulfil admission requirements."I certainly would encourage any student who is interested in coming to UBC or another Canadian post-secondary institution to reach out to the schools they're interested in and see what's possible in terms of alternate ways to recognize the work that they've done," she said.Chan is now planning to get a diploma in marketing or computer science to enhance his employability and hopes Tong will soon be able to rejoin him in B.C."Salaries in Canada may not be as high as in Hong Kong, but we will be able to live here with a peace of mind," Chan said. 23 hours ago Local Journalism Initiative COVID-19 patients transferred to Vancouver Island to ease stress on northern ICUs The increasing number of people with severe COVID-19 symptoms is stressing ICU capacities in the north and patients have been transferred to other regions to ensure adequate critical care services can continue to be provided in Northern Health, said a spokesperson. “We are seeing increased need for hospitalizations and patients needing critical care,” said Eryn Collins, Northern Health media relations manager. On Dec. 4, there were 39 people with COVID-19 listed in Northern Health, with 11 of those patients in critical care. Almost 70 per cent of the total 101 hospitalizations in Northern Health have taken place in the last 34 days. “We still have capacity to provide critical care in our northern system,” said Eryn Collins. “But we’re also seeing an increase in that level of need, so we’re accessing that capacity elsewhere in the province.” Recently, two patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were transferred to a Vancouver Island hospital. “It’s very important in some of our regional hospitals, such as Mills Memorial, that we ensure there is adequate ICU capacity in case of other circumstances that occur,” said Health Minister Adrian Dix on Dec. 3. “For example, the potential – especially this time of year – of a major accident on the highway.” According to the Ministry of Health, as of Nov. 30, 17 of the 41 ICU and critical care-type beds in Northern Health were vacant and an additional 23 ‘surge’ beds could be deployed, if necessary. Northern Health has the fewest beds of all the health authorities but it also has the smallest population. “The capacity and occupancy varies, not just for us, but for every health region in the province,” said Collins. The ministry’s latest count indicated two of five beds were unoccupied in Mills Memorial Hospital in Terrace; three of four ICU beds were vacant in Fort St. John; eight of 23 beds were vacant at University Hospital of Northern BC in Prince George, and four of 9 beds were open throughout the rest of the north. There were also 100 ventilators across the region, according to Northern Health. “Where appropriate, patients are moved,” Dix said. “Sometimes from the north to Vancouver Island or Metro Vancouver.” The ability to transfer patients across health authorities is an essential aspect of the government’s pandemic response plan released in March by Dix, Deputy Health Minister Stephen Brown and Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. “It was made clear at that time that this was the potential that we would be looking at if we started to see a certain trajectory of COVID activity and hospitalizations,” said Collins. “And we are, along with the rest of the province, seeing those increases.” About 56 per cent of the people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the north (and in B.C.) had done so since Oct. 31. Provincially, almost 50 per cent of all hospitalizations have taken place in the last month or so. As of Dec. 4, in Northern Health, 978 people had tested positive, while 36,132 people had been diagnosed provincially. Despite the added pressure of COVID-19 patients on the healthcare system, the province continues to have 76 per cent occupancy rate in its critical care beds. When surge beds are included in the ICU count, the occupancy rate drops to less than 65 per cent, said Dix. The province-wide pandemic strategy outlined how the healthcare system would maintain 17 COVID-19 care sites and ensure adequate capacity under a range of potential pandemic scenarios. The plan revealed the number of acute care beds, ICU-type beds, ventilators, and additional surge beds that could be deployed to meet evolving healthcare demands across B.C. during the pandemic. “We are using, as is the rest of the province, the capacity that is in the provincial healthcare system… to make sure that we can continue to care for everyone’s needs, not just COVID-related,” said Collins. Patients are commonly transported to other regions for specialized treatment, such as cardiac care in Vancouver or other reasons not to do with COVID-19, Collins said. “That’s something that happens all the time in health care,” said Dix. “What you are seeing is the public health care system working as it should in a pandemic.” Fran@thegoatnews.ca / @FranYanorFran Yanor, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, The Rocky Mountain Goat 23 hours ago Ad•Club Mahindra Why this Ad?

And then we ship a lot to Alberta and just because of the distance, they have to go fairly early in November."Traffic up at U-CutBut, it's not just the markets in the U.S. and Alberta that are booming.Folkins said she's seen more visitors to the farm's U-Cut, which she attributes to the pandemic keeping people closer to home."The snowbirds aren't going south or a lot of them aren't," said Folkins. "A lot of people working from home. So they're saying, 'Well, I guess we're going to be here, we might as well fix up and put some lights on and just feel festive'."She also said more people have been abandoning artificial trees lately, getting bored with the same tree year after year."That's the wonderful thing about a real tree, is that it's never the same next year," said Folkins. "No matter how hard you try to duplicate it … there's something different in what nature provides for us."She said she used to sell a lot of trees to Ontario, but a past glut of trees dried up that market.She then discovered the Alberta market was in need of trees.Maritimes pining for firsFolkins said spruce will grow in Alberta but it's generally too dry to grow the balsam fir she produces, and that's what many people are looking for, including some New Brunswick expats."There's an awful lot of Maritimers in Alberta and spruce doesn't cut it for them," said Folkins. "They want a fir. They want something that reminds them of home."Folkins said COVID-19 protocols are in place, meaning people will have to wear masks when they visit the U-Cut and stay in their household bubble. But there's lots of room for physical distancing and plenty of trees left."I can't imagine that we've ever run out of trees," said Folkins. 21 hours ago CBC Why international travellers are allowed to connect to domestic flights without quarantine Jacob Frey never thought international travellers would be on his WestJet flight from Calgary to Edmonton — until he spotted several passengers wearing sombreros in the waiting area. After boarding the Nov. 22 flight, Frey said he learned that the passenger seated next to him and three passengers in the row behind were returning from vacation resorts in Mexico. "I was shocked,"said Frey, a laid-off sewer construction worker from Saskatoon who was flying to Edmonton to scope out job prospects. Frey worried that sitting near passengers who had visited resorts in Mexico could increase his chances of being exposed to the virus. "People going to an all-inclusive resort during a pandemic, that's inherently irresponsible," he said. "So it's obvious that health is not their primary concern." When Canadian passengers take domestic flights during the COVID-19 pandemic, they may be sharing the cabin with international travellers on a connecting flight who have yet to quarantine. Although many travellers entering Canada must quarantine for 14 days, they don't have to start the process until reaching their final destination — as long as they have no COVID-19 symptoms. When asked about this policy, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC News that the risk of COVID-19 transmission on a plane is relatively low compared to other enclosed settings. Many travellers take connecting flights Since Canada closed its borders to most non-essential travel in late March, more than 1.5 million Canadians and foreigners have entered the country by air. Between March and September, an estimated 17 per cent of air passengers arriving in Canada took a connecting domestic flight, according to data compiled by Transport Canada. Several countries, including Australia and New Zealand, require travellers to quarantine at their first point-of-entry before taking connecting flights. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist, says that's an extreme approach to combating the virus' spread that may not go over well with Canadian travellers. "I think in general, many people would not be accepting of having to stay in a quarantine hotel at that point of arrival." Dr. Bogoch, based at Toronto General Hospital, also said it's unclear how beneficial a point-of-entry quarantine policy would be in Canada, considering the number of COVID-19 infections associated with international travel is small. "It's a drop in the bucket. So you have to ask yourself, would a policy like that significantly contribute to our pandemic response?" Over the past eight months, the percentage of COVID-19 cases linked to international travel has ranged from 0.4 per cent in May to 2.9 per cent in July, according to PHAC. Last month it was 0.6 per cent. Passenger tests positive PHAC data also shows that, since March 25, more than 2,000 domestic and international flights in Canada have carried at least one passenger who, shortly afterwards, tested positive for COVID-19. Frey learned five days after his WestJet flight that someone seated near him had tested positive. He said he got tested and was negative, but Alberta Health Services still directed him to quarantine for 14 days. "Basically, I'm sidelined for two weeks," said Frey who's self-isolating at a friend's place in Edmonton. "It's frustrating." He doesn't know if the COVID-19-positive passenger was returning from Mexico. Even so, Frey said if he had known that international travellers would be on his flight, he would have cancelled it — unless Westjet provided assurances they'd be seated in a separate section. "They can be the first ones on the plane, last ones off and keep them separate from everyone else," he said. WestJet told CBC News that it's not necessary to separate international and domestic passengers on a plane, because the airline has implemented stringent health and hygiene policies, and Canadian health officials have found that the risk of transmission on an aircraft is low. Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. Teresa Tam said last month that protective measures such as mandatory mask policies, health screenings and effective ventilation systems have made planes a relatively safe place to be during the pandemic. "The modern aircraft is actually really good in terms of air exchanges and the way airflow occurs in the cabin," she said. "There have been very few reports — extremely rare reports, actually — of transmission aboard aircraft." WATCH | How airborne transmission increases the need for ventillation: Dr. Bogosh agrees that the actual plane ride is fairly safe, but said there are other aspects of air travel that pose a danger such as boarding and exiting the aircraft, and picking up checked luggage. "There is a risk because there's more bottlenecks and people crowding together." He added that domestic passengers also pose a threat due to surging COVID-19 infections in Canada, so the best way to avoid exposure is not to travel. "We should be staying as close to home as possible, avoiding non-essential trips." 23 hours ago Ad•Morningstar Why this Ad? Ad Feedback Why don't you like this ad?

Ad5 Questions To Answer Before You Invest Meagre experience with money should not hold you back. Young investors can use this as a checklist to build a strong foundation. The Canadian Press Romania: Election expected to usher in 'European' generation BUCHAREST, Romania — Romanians will vote Sunday in a legislative election expected to restore some measure of stability in a country with one of the European Union's highest emigration rates, and bring to power a generation that came of age in a time of national turmoil and strongly identifies as European. Cabinet shakeups and no-confidence votes have given Romania five prime ministers in as many years. According to most pre-election polls, the weekend vote is likely to favour reform-oriented politicians united in their resolve to keep Romania in step with the EU mainstream and away from the camp of other post-communist nations, such as Hungary and Poland, with their populist, euroskeptic leaders. The centre-right National Liberal Party, known by its Romanian acronym PNL, appears set to become the top vote-getter. But the mainstay party of Romania's EU-aligned, austerity-prone social conservatives is expected to fall far short of a parliamentary majority. Its main rival, the left-leaning, populist Social Democratic Party, or PSD in Romanian, won the last election in 2016 and ran through three prime ministers before PNL first took the reins of a minority government a year ago. The PSD-led government had drawn heavy criticism from the EU for its interference with the judiciary and a cascade of corruption scandals involving some of its most prominent members. The Social Democrats' chaotic tenure triggered two years of massive street protests that gave voice to a new generation of relatively young, foreign-educated and proudly European politicians who point to widespread graft and fraud in Romanian government ministries and state institutions. Some of them now are running for seats in parliament. “There are many state institutions under political control which function really badly, and the problems there need to be exposed,” said Valeriu Nicolae, a human rights activist who is running as an independent candidate. “MPs never tackled these issues because everyone has an interest in these state institutions. They either have relatives working there, friends or party members, and it’s not nice to expose your friends.” Nicolae is an initiator of the RESPECT anti-racism campaign in football, launched at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, one of the most visible campaigns of this sort in the world, and says that in the past he was “treated horribly (for) being Roma” in Romania. He said he decided to run after witnessing what he considered to be a weak effort to prevent “a man accused of horrible things and a very dubious person” winning a district mayor's election in the capital, Bucharest. In one week, Nicolae collected 13,000 qualifying signatures, 3,500 more than he needed to get on Sunday's ballot. “I am convinced that (change) is possible,” he said. “I am not bound by an interest to protect my political career. My life quality will suffer if I get into parliament.” A more organized new force is USR-PLUS, a mix of pro-EU technocrats and social-justice and anti-corruption activists that coalesced last year into a progressive political alliance. Polls predict the alliance, whose members hold divergent views on many cultural issues, will get around 20% of Sunday’s vote for both chambers of parliament. That's the same share forecast for the PSD, which has dominated Romanian politics since the fall of communism in 1989. The alliance has targeted young and disillusioned voters, including with pledges to depoliticize and fully reform Romania's civil service and eradicate corruption. It has also promised to eliminate income tax for minimum-wage workers and create well-paying jobs to lure back young, highly educated Romanians who have been leaving in droves since the country joined the EU in 2007. “It’s good to see a new generation of leaders who understand the needs of our society and are professionally and personally fit to meet them,” said Dacian Ciolos, who represents Romania in the European Parliament and is one of the progressive alliance’s top leaders. “It puts pressure on us, as a new political entity, because we have to meet higher expectations.” The alliance has pledged not to be part of a parliamentary majority that would include the PSD, which has accused prominent USR-PLUS members of being part of a dark anti-Romanian conspiracy linked to Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, a favourite bogeyman of Central European populists. At the same time, USR-PLUS has indicated it has no intention of playing second fiddle to the PNL in a future coalition government. Some analysts predict the USR-PLUS alliance will try to assert itself in a future governing coalition by demanding a reconfiguration of the government and the prime minister's job for Ciolos, 51. He served a stint at the helm of Romania’s first, short-lived technocratic government several years ago. It would be a bitter pill for the PNL, but one it might be forced to swallow if it wants to preserve its image as a party driven by a genuine desire to rid Romania of a corruptive welfare state model, which it blames on PSD's decades-long dominance. Most analysts think the conservative PNL and the progressive alliance will find a compromise. “It’s in their best interest to govern together despite their (ideological and economic) differences which are incomprehensible to most of their supporters,” political analyst Andrei Taranu said. Romania was plagued by widespread poverty before the coronavirus pandemic, with over 25% of the population of 19 million living on less than $5.50 a day. The pandemic has exacerbated structural problems, including the near collapse of the public health care system. To date, the EU's seventh-most populous country has confirmed over a half-million virus cases and more than 12,000 deaths. As a result of the pandemic and virus containment measures, Romania’s fiscal deficit is expected to widen this year to around 9% of gross domestic product, compared with 4.3% in 2019. Nicolae, who himself grew up in poverty, has dedicated his life to helping vulnerable children escape a life of misery and drug-abuse, and giving them access to education. “Although I say all the time ‘I’m a gypsy I’m a gypsy,’ people no longer register me like that” he said. ”That I, a Romanian Roma, ran as an independent and I managed to gather the necessary signatures, is a very good signal. And if I win, it would be a great signal." Some 18 million people are registered to vote on Sunday at 18,000 polling stations across the country. In a reflection of the importance of the Romanian diaspora living and working abroad, there are also 748 polling stations in other countries, almost twice as many as there were four years ago. Voters will be filling 136 seats in the Senate and 329 in the Chamber of Deputies. No special virus precautions have been put in place beyond the general requirements to wear masks, sanitize hands and maintain social distancing. ___ Andreea Alexandru in Bucharest contributed. By Vadim Ghirda And Sabina Niksic, The Associated Press 22 hours ago CBC As U.S. hospitals fill up, doctor hopes viral photo will serve as a warning For Dr. Joseph Varon it was a chance to offer a moment of comfort amidst so much uncertainty, a moment that he didn't realize would touch so many lives beyond the elderly patient in front of him. The chief of staff at Houston's United Memorial Medical Center was going through the COVID-19 unit when he came upon an elderly man alone in his room overcome with grief. "He was crying, crying like a baby," Varon said. "He tells me, 'I want to be with my wife.' And, man, when he said: 'I want to be with my wife,' I just embrace him. I just hug him, and eventually he stopped crying."Varon didn't realize at the time that the photo was being taken. He often allows the media access to his health-care facility and that day he was being shadowed by Getty Images photographer Go Nakamura. The image, posted to Facebook, spread quickly across social networks. It captures the anguish felt by many of the thousands of people in COVID-19 units, where patients aren't allowed to have visitors, and health-care workers must don the protective gear that Varon calls a "space suit."A dire situationIt's a scene playing out across the United States with increasing frequency, as hospitals fill up in record numbers with COVID-19 patients. There were 101,276 patients in U.S. hospitals with COVID-19 as of Friday, the most recent date for which the data was available, and the highest number since the pandemic began, according to the COVID Tracking Project. About 14.3 million people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in the U.S., according to statistics kept by Johns Hopkins University. And with more than 279,000 dead, the U.S. now has 102,000 more deaths due to the coronavirus than Brazil, which has the second-highest number of deaths and about 6.5 million cases.And the situation in the U.S. is expected to get worse. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimates that if the country remains on its current trajectory there will be 345,435 deaths by Dec. 31.The latest numbers follow a staggering November in which the U.S. set a new record of more than four million cases in the month. That's more than double the previous record set in October, with the impact being felt in health-care systems across the country. Bill Hanage, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, isn't surprised.WATCH | Answering a call for help:"The hospitalizations reflect the fact that we are entering the first full winter season of the pandemic in the northern hemisphere, and there have not been huge efforts to prevent transmission in much of the United States," Hanage said.A difficult road aheadThe grim statistics come at a time of heightened optimism that the end of the pandemic is near, with the potential arrival of vaccines in the coming weeks. But that optimism is being tempered by a stinging dose of reality from the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control."December and January and February are gonna be rough times. I actually believe they're gonna be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation," CDC director Robert Redfield said Wednesday.Speaking at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, he said one of the most concerning things about the current situation is that 90 per cent of U.S. hospitals are "red zones," or areas of high infection, so there's a high risk of going over capacity."We are at a very critical time right now about being able to maintain the resilience of our health-care system," Redfield said.He pointed out that in the spring, the hotspots were limited to a handful of cities, and health-care resources could be shifted from other areas, something that can't happen now with the pandemic covering the entire country.A patchwork approachHowever, Hanage says that parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic differently, largely due to a patchwork of precautions.So New York City, where masks are required in most settings where physical distancing isn't possible, isn't seeing hospitalizations reach a point as bad as in the spring. While in North and South Dakota, which have resisted making masks mandatory, the incident rate is among the highest in the world.In Rhode Island, the state has opened two field hospitals to help the system as it nears capacity, with the Governor Gina Marie Raimondo calling on anyone with experience in healthcare to help deal with staffing shortages.WATCH | The risk of no more hospital bedsIn California, Governor Gavin Newsom announced new stay-at-home orders will be triggered in certain regions across the state if intensive care unit capacity drops below 15 per cent. In Ohio, a grim bellwether of difficult days ahead came with the arrival of refrigeration trucks outside some health-care facilities as morgues fill up."When you see refrigerator trucks, that's a pretty good kick in the teeth for us to understand that this is the reality. This is what we're facing," Ohio Governor Mike De Wine said during a coronavirus briefing Thursday.The holiday impactThe message from public health authorities and front-line workers across the country is to follow basic steps to prevent the virus, from mask wearing, to physical distancing, to remaining home as much as possible. Meanwhile, the effects of a busy Thanksgiving holiday travel season are just starting to ripple through the system and there are fears that more travel and large gatherings over Christmastime could lead to more infections.Hanage says the Christmas holidays are particularly worrisome because it's possible that older people, who are more vulnerable than other age groups, will be at large gatherings. He also worries that the country will suffer because of the places taking the fewest precautions. "We're only as strong as the weakest link, and unfortunately, there are a lot of places in the United States which have been pretty weak."A stern messageAt United Memorial, Varon says his small community hospital is essentially being overtaken by COVID-19 patients. Out of 120 beds, he said 88 were for COVID patients, and that number is rising every day.Varon echoed Redfield's comments about what's to come, but took a more blunt tone when asked how he feels about people travelling and gathering in large numbers over the holidays."I would like to slap them," Varon said. "Because of people like them, the next six weeks are going to be the darkest weeks in modern American medical history. Simple as that." He blames COVID fatigue for causing people to drop their guard, and while he understands the feeling, he says people need to understand why health-care workers are speaking out."We health-care providers are also humans, we also feel your pain and I like to tell people: 'Look at the picture, because I do not want you to be on the next picture.'" 23 hours ago CBC Nova Scotia's new rent cap, 'renoviction' ban could change under next premier All three of the men vying to be the next premier of Nova Scotia say they'll stick with parts of the affordable housing plan laid out by the government last week — but depending on who wins the leadership vote, the rent cap and "renoviction" ban could change.Housing Minister Chuck Porter announced the temporary two per cent cap last Wednesday, along with a ban on eviction orders for renovations. Both of those measures are tied to the COVID-19 state of emergency order, and could be wiped away at the end of the pandemic — or sooner, depending on what happens on Feb. 6.That's the day the Nova Scotia Liberal Party chooses its next leader and the next premier of the province."It's too hard to predict exactly what situation we're going to be in in February," said Randy Delorey.The recent health minister, now leadership contender, said he would wait to see how the pandemic progresses before deciding what to do with the new housing measures."We need to continue to be nimble and responsive to the needs of Nova Scotians to make sure that they are kept safe in this particular time," he said in an interview.Although equivocal on the rent cap and renoviction ban, Delorey said he was in favour of the new affordable housing commission — a group of stakeholders who will advise the province on long-term solutions to the housing crunch."I think that's the most important thing, I think the commission is a critical step," he said.Higher rent cap under Rankin, KousoulisPorter's housing announcement came two weeks after Delorey's two competitors for the leadership pitched their own plans for addressing the province's affordable housing shortage. Some of the central tenets of Iain Rankin's proposal were similar to what's now in effect. Rankin said he would apply a rent cap and eviction ban for the duration of the pandemic. But he proposed a higher ceiling for rent increases — between four and 10 per cent, depending on the age of the building. He told CBC News this week he still thinks those are the right numbers."What I thought was unreasonable was rent increases that were going beyond the 10 per cent," he said.Rankin also proposed striking a committee of stakeholders to advise the province on affordable housing, in the same vein as Porter's housing commission. Rankin said the new commission is missing something: people with lived experience."But I'm not going to be critical of that," Rankin said, "because I wanted action, I've been asking for action … and I'm happy to see the government addressing [this issue]."The rent cap would likely go up to four per cent under a Labi Kousoulis government, too. He said he agrees with at least one of the concerns raised by landlords about the province's two per cent cap: it could lead to deferred maintenance on rental units.He said he's committed to the general direction of the new government policies, but if he's the next premier, they would be "overlayed" by his own housing plan.Kousoulis's plan is to keep the rent cap in place for four years, which he said is the amount of time needed to address the underlying issue. According to him, that's a lack of supply, and "red tape" barriers to new development.As for the ban on renovictions, Kousoulis said that kind of "heavy, heavy measure from government" is something that would have to be monitored closely.

After growing up seeing a lack of representation of persons with disabilities in the world of fashion, he decided to do something himself with his free time during the COVID-19 pandemic."I was like 'You know what? If nobody else has done this before me, I'm just going to be the guy to do it,'" Bolianatz said. In Oct. 2020, Bolianatz launched the Best Legs Supply Company. Every piece of clothing features the handicapped symbol shown on parking stalls or bathroom doors. "The whole thing is centred around using disabilities as a pride thing rather than like something to look down on," he said. "Let's take that. Let's put it on my shirt. Let's get people excited about it."John Loeppky is a disabled artist and freelance writer who often speaks about issues affecting people with disabilities. He said it's Boliantz's idea is great. "What Bryson is talking about in terms of reclaiming that symbol that has, sort of hangs over the community in some ways, and reclaiming it through a Saskatchewan clothing brand, I think that's a great millennial way of doing things," Loeppky said. Bolianatz designs each piece of clothing himself as things he would like to wear out, he said. They often have bright colours. He likes to make sure 'Best Legs' is on each as well."A lot of people like when they hear the name 'Best Legs,' they kind of like laugh … no doubt, there is like an element of comedy to it," Bolianatz said. "The way I look at it is 'Best Legs' doesn't necessarily mean like our legs are the best. It just means that we as a community and as a group of people do the best we can with what we've been given."The response has been more than expected, Bolianatz said. "Actually a lot of my sales, and this is something that I'm actually really proud of, have come from able-bodied people, which I think is super important," he said. He wanted to reach other people with disabilities and was glad to see able-bodied people get on board, he said. There was even an exciting collaboration with the music group Portugal. The Man."Their guitarist, Eric Howk is his name, he is a wheelchair user. When I was starting the company and trying to get stuff off the ground, I reached out to him on Instagram and I was like, 'Hey, man, I know this is kind of a shot in the dark, but this is what I'm doing.'"Harlock responded and said he was absolutely on board. Boliantz said he couldn't believe the famous musician was interested in a collaboration. In the future, Bolianatz said he hopes to get Best Legs to be a mainstream company that people can recognize simply on the street. "I wanted to get to a point where everybody is like, 'Oh yeah, I'll wear this," he said. "'This is cool clothing and a cool message.'" 21 hours ago CBC Red squirrels going nuts for Ottawa couple's Christmas lights, but reason remains a mystery Red squirrels have again chewed off and carried away hundreds of dollars worth of festive lights from one Ottawa neighbourhood, making spirits not so bright this Christmas.Just why the bulb bandits are doing it remains a mystery, however.It started last year when Michael and Sarah McCabe hung three 150-bulb strings on their backyard fence outside their home in the Manor Park neighbourhood — as they had for the past three decades. But a couple of weeks into December, the display mysteriously went dark.When they investigated, the McCabes found the wires chewed through and several bulbs gone."We're trying to figure out what they're doing with the bulbs, because they cut the wire to both sides and we can't find them anywhere," Michael McCabe said.This year, thinking the squirrels had objected to the lights atop the fence because they interfered with their backyard "highway," the McCabes moved the lights to their back deck.But before December had even arrived, the rodents absconded with more bulbs — about $200 worth.A few houses down the street, Bob Porter has had the same costly problem."I just replaced the strings two days ago. Heaven forbid they chew them again," Porter said.Picky crittersThere are several theories about why the squirrels appear determined to stop Christmas from coming.Though the rascally rodents don't seem to favour any particular colour, they have indicated a preference for LED bulbs manufactured for Canadian retailers by the Chinese company Ting Shen — the very lights the McCabes began using last year.But at least one retailer said it's unaware of the problem."This is the first time we have received customer feedback about squirrels damaging Christmas lights," wrote Meghan Furman, a spokesperson for Home Hardware, where the McCabes purchased their lights. "We take all customer concerns seriously and are looking into this unusual incident."Porter purchased his Ting Shen-made lights, marketed under the Noma brand, from Canadian Tire."I feel their pain," said Bill Dowd, a former Ottawa 67's hockey player who started Skedaddle Humane Wildlife Control after hanging up his skates.Dowd's company also installs seasonal lights and is frequently called upon to replace bulbs that have been stolen by red squirrels.One theory suggests that the animals are drawn to the bulbs because they're tasty."Would you believe the plastic insulation that covers various electrical wires is soy-based?" police in Plainfield, Ill., posted online recently in an attempt to explain the phenomenon before citizens call to report the vandalism.Rodents have also been blamed for taste-testing the bioplastic insulation used in modern automotive wiring.WATCH | Squirrels rule the roost over family's festive decorations:Always experimenting"They're wired to try out new stuff," explained Ottawa naturalist Dan Brunton.But Brunton utterly rejects the theory that the rodents have been duped by either the flavour or shape of the bulbs."Nope. They'd know that after bite one," he said, explaining that the red squirrel's unique survival strategy is to constantly experiment, testing their environment for possible new food sources.Before humans, houses and plastics appeared on the landscape, it was a sound strategy."They're applying wild techniques to urbanized human landscapes, and sometimes it can be really weird. But sometimes it works to their advantage," Brunton said.The McCabes have had enough of the experimentation — they say that next year, they'll be keeping their Christmas lights inside the house. 22 hours ago CBC Family of 15-year-old demands answers after TCDSB makes him attend in-person classes * UPDATE: Since CBC first started investigating this story, the TCDSB has offered Nekeba Cuff a full online learning option.The family of a 15-year-old boy who lives in one of the neighbourhoods hardest hit by COVID-19 is pushing the Toronto Catholic District School Board to let him learn full-time from home — despite the board's policy that students who have been suspended must attend in-person classes.Nekeba Cuff, a Grade 10 student, was suspended in October for stabbing another student. When a TCDSB student is suspended or expelled, he or she is invited to attend the Transitional Intervention Program for Suspended Students (TIPSS), while waiting for an expulsion hearing.Where a student attends TIPSS is based on where they live. Cuff had been traveling by bus from his home near Jane Street and Finch Avenue West to classes at the Toronto Public Library branch in The Junction near Jane Street and Dundas Street West. Cuff's mother, Kisher Thomas, says she feels the TCDSB is forcing her to choose between her son's health and his education."With COVID going around I'm concerned about his safety. Imagine going out, something happens, and God forbid, you get infected. What are you going to tell me? 'Oh, we're sorry?'"Family wants same choice other students were givenThe Ministry of Education requires all school boards to provide the option of full-time online classes this school year."School boards must work collaboratively with parents to ensure that all students have access to remote learning," the ministry said in a statement.Cuff's relatives say that option wasn't immediately available to him.The TCDSB says although it is committed to ensuring all expelled students have the opportunity to continue their education, some classes may be in person."Under the Education Act PPM 142 - School Board Programs for Expelled Students, the program includes an assessment of the attitudes and behaviour of the student as well as observing and assessing their interaction with other students and staff, all of which requires in-person attendance," the TCDSB told CBC News in a written statement.The TCDSB has since confirmed it will accommodate families who request a fully remote option during the pandemic, including those of students in suspension or expulsion programs, to "ensure the safety and well-being of a child." Thomas says she requested full online learning for Cuff in November, ahead of his expulsion hearing.Paul Raso, executive director of the non-profit organization Education Involved Advocacy Group, helped the family through the process.Raso, who is also a former vice principal for the TCDSB and worked in the Jane and Finch area for nearly 20 years, says the family was told by a TCDSB Superintendent that there was no virtual option. Raso says a lawyer working for the board emailed the family an alternative, which stated "there is likely a solution that would accommodate a learning model where the student attended 3 days in-person and 2 days virtually with 80% attendance in both."Thomas worries about the risk of Cuff getting the novel coronavirus on public transit or in a taxi. Having recently lost a grandmother to COVID-19, it's a big issue for the family and other people in their community.COVID-19 affects Black people and other people of colour disproportionately in Toronto, according to data gathered by the city. The figures show that's particularly true for those living in low-income areas. ICES, a non-profit research institute, reported the COVID positivity rate in the Jane and Finch area is more than 15 per cent, the seventh highest in the province.TCDSB must take boy's trauma into account, mentor saysAfter years in behavioural classes and special education, Nekeba ended up in the program following two suspensions. One incident was from a high school in North York where he threatened a teacher, and the second landed him a limited expulsion from Chaminade College School for stabbing a student in the leg in October.The most recent incident is still before the courts.Thomas says her son was remorseful but must take responsibility for his decisions."Right after that altercation, he took the shirt off his back to help the other student he hurt and wrapped it around his leg."Raso's been trying to help Cuff since he was in Grade 6 and has vouched for him to the board."I've watched this kid grow up. He's smart, he's funny and he's great in school when he can get support, but we need to provide more options for students dealing with serious trauma," he said.Trauma has followed the teen throughout his life, Raso says.Two weeks before the suspensions, Nekeba and his mother saw the immediate aftermath of a double homicide right outside their door. Nekeba looked out their window and saw two men on the ground bleeding. His mother actually placed the 911 call.Thomas says living through traumatic experiences like that shooting in October of last year, and the deaths of close friends, has severely affected her son's mental health and social abilities.Raso says no one from the school or the board ever called to check up on the teen after the shooting. And, he says, the board fails to factor in the trauma, or the dangers kids like Nekeba face when they're moved from one school to another."To send a kid from Jane and Finch who fears for his life because of the things he's experienced to a school just north of Regent Park, in another gang's territory, could be a matter of life and death even as a bystander," he said.Raso says that's the reason he left the TCDSB — he "couldn't take going to anymore students' funerals."When CBC News asked the Ministry of Education what it's doing to ensure the safety of students in communities such as Jane and Finch, the ministry responded that it's provided millions of dollars in additional funding to the area that could be used to hire more staff, students supports and pay for more technology. Next stepsRaso and the family got an appeal hearing with the TCDSB on Dec. 2 The TCDSB says school administrators and staff want to work with families to develop an appropriate student action plan and also to address any concerns they may have, but the family says they don't feel the board has done that.Thomas says they were contacted on Friday by the board with an offer for full time online learning but no formal intake meeting has taken place to discuss that option yet.She says she is taking the weekend to think about the meeting but questions the board's ability to help her son because she doesn't trust them.Thomas says her family will continue discussions for Cuff's education and perhaps help other students in the same situation.In the meantime, they have pulled Cuff from the TIPSS program and are seeking other options.They are now planning to file a human rights complaint against the TCDSB."Ultimately, we want to see kids in this board treated with dignity and respect in this program," Raso said.
